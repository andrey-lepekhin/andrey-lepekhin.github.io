Hey there!

![That's me]({{ "/images/Andrey_Lepekhin_2023.png" | absolute_url }})

My name is Andrey Lepekhin. 
I seek, test and implement systems that help me reach my goals: whether it's through accountability partners, anti-procrastination techniques, psychotherapy, or [biohacking]({% post_url 2018-06-02-Biohacking-and-me %}).



My fascination with information technology has allowed me to explore a variety of roles within the field. While I once took on the role of a product manager, I have since returned to my roots as a backend developer.    
I read a lot of fiction (any _HPMOR_ or _Worm_ fans out here?), as well as rationalist blogs (Slate Star Codex, Zvi) and about IT in general (Hacker news).

I _love_ dancing to popular music (like [_Hurts - Ready to Go_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP2G3dm_fsc&t=37)) and I do indulge myself daily.  

If you are in ~~Moscow~~Bishkek and want to meet up – shoot me an email – I would love to chat offline. I've found that meeting with like-minded people makes for captivating dialogues, and that is another thing that I absolutely love.


[My process and goals for writing in this blog]({% post_url 2018-03-10-My-process-and-goals-for-writing-in-this-blog %})

**I welcome criticism**, as one of this blog's primary goals is to help me improve. If you think something could have been done/written better, you're probably right and I would be grateful for your insights and appreciate you taking the time to share them with me.
