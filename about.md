Hey there!

![That's me]({{ "/images/Andrey_Lepekhin.png" | absolute_url }})

I'm Andrey. Sometimes being a human is hard and I've fallen many a time.  
I seek, test and implement systems to help me with reaching my goals:  
be it accountability partners, anti-procrastination techniques, psychotherapy or even Goal-Crafting Intensives :)



I'm fascinated by IT and I work as a product & project manager. I read a lot of fiction (any _HPMOR_ or _Worm_ fans out here?).

I _love_ dancing to popular music (like [_Hurts - Ready to Go_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP2G3dm_fsc&t=37)) and I do indulge myself daily.  

If you are from Moscow, and want to meet - shoot me an email - I would love to chat offline. I've found that meeting with like-minded people makes for captivating dialogues and that is another thing that I absolutely love.
