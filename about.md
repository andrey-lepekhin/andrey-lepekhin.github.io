Hey there!  
![My photo]({{ "/images/Andrey_Lepekhin_2023.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: width="200" }

My name is Andrey Lepekhin (*Lee-pyo-khin*).  
I'm on a journey to lead a fulfilled and contented life. I try out different strategies, diving into applied psychology, mindfulness and more esoteric practices. This is my blog, where I spill my thoughts, share my learnings, and talk about anything that interests me.  

Here's a little more about me.

* I enjoy **meaningful conversations** that bring people closer. Over the years, I've facilitated many such dialogues, and I find them deeply rewarding. I love talking with others, whether one-on-one or in a group setting. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to connect with people on a deeper level, so if you're interested, let's talk!

* I'm fascinated with **information technology**. In the last 15 years, I've worked in various roles in this field, from startups to big corporations like Yandex. I've handled business analysis, quality assurance, project management, and software development, and I've also led teams of developers.

* I'm a huge fan of **science fiction**. This genre has been my trusted companion for the past 25 years. Take a look at my [top three favorite books]({% post_url 2022-07-09-My-favorite-fiction-books %}). I'd be more than happy to suggest your next sci-fi book or receive any recommendations from you. Besides, I also read brain-tingling blogs like [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/) and [Zvi](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/), along with tech-related content from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). 

* As a **mentor**, I help my mentees understand the root cause of their challenges, rather than just battling symptoms like procrastination. We experiment together to find effective ways to reach their goals, without resorting to self-blame as motivation.

* I love to **dance**, especially free movement styles like freedom dance, ecstatic dance, and authentic movement. If you're hosting an event with these, count me in!
 
Currently in ~~Moscow~~ ~~Bishkek~~ Helsinki, I'm eager to connect with people who share similar interests for engaging chats. So, if something about what you see caught your fancy, feel free to reach out!

### Criticism
I appreciate constructive feedback, since one of the main goals of this blog is to help me grow. If you think something could be improved, I'd be thankful for your insights and value your effort to share them with me.
