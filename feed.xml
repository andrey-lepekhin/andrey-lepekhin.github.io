&lt;p&gt;The articles were designed to get attention, so please look past misused memes and click-baity headings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/im-32-and-spent-200k-on-biohacking-became-calmer-thinner-extroverted-healthier-happier-2a2e846ae113&quot;&gt;I’m 32 and spent $200k on biohacking. Became calmer, thinner, extroverted, healthier &amp;amp; happier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/how-i-set-and-execute-50-year-goals-why-i-see-cutting-in-lines-as-morally-right-f4d0ce28574f&quot;&gt;How I set and execute 50-year goals + why I see cutting in lines as morally right&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serge was also a CEO of a company I’m working for. While still a CEO, he did several seminars where he described his reasoning and methods behind (then called) life-optimization. I am one of the people that that was sold on the less-than-hardcore part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A qurterly blood panel of around 50 blood markers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation of strategies to change the markers that are not in the green (e.g. try supplements, change training routines, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eat less sugar. Switching from a lifetime consumption of the family-recipe homemade jam was hard at first, but now I actually enjoy how food tastes without any added sweetness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intermittent fasting protocol where I eat during 6-8 hours of a day, leaving the rest to fasting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the moment I experiment sleeping at the same times daily: going to bed before 22:00 and waking up at 06:30.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditate daily&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free weights exercise. I used to do HIIT, but paused as my main goal is gaining muscle at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I haven’t done yet but plan to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ketogenic diet for reported cognitive enhancements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prolonged fasting as a cancer prevention&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SSRIs and &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; drugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More sleep experiments (&lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; darkness, coolness, and optimal CO2) with help form some devices like oura ring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All-in-all, I do not see some overwhelming results, though I do benefit from my life being more structured, i.e. when I &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/01/Why-choices-are-bad&quot;&gt;don’t have to decide&lt;/a&gt; whether and when get out of bed, or what to eat today.&lt;br /&gt;
I view it all as a hobby that probably has some benefits of increasing my health and happiness. Also a handy conversation piece.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="biohacking" /><category term="goal" /><summary type="html">Serge Faguet is an entrepreneur that has written three long controversial articles on Hackernoon and revamped the term ‘biohacking’ for me.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">85 Things I learned being a CEO</title><link href="https://www.lepekhin.com/2018/05/20/85-things-i-learned-being-a-ceo" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="85 Things I learned being a CEO" /><published>2018-05-20T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2018-05-20T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>https://www.lepekhin.com/2018/05/20/85-things-i-learned-being-a-ceo</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lepekhin.com/2018/05/20/85-things-i-learned-being-a-ceo">&lt;p&gt;A Hackernoon &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/85-things-i-learned-being-a-ceo-4c25fc1c7b99&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;em&gt;Sachin Gupta&lt;/em&gt; details lessons from his CEO career in the areas of job’s key responsibilities, decision making, culture, leadership, self-management, people management, meetings, hiring, and fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the most relevant for me are these parts about meetings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Explicitly ask people if you are needed to be part of a meeting. Wherever you are needed, ask them for an agenda and also ask what is expected from you in the meeting. Else say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are only 2 types of meetings that you should attend — a) where you have to take a decision b) where you get updates/information. The productivity of the first depends solely on you and the latter on how you have trained your team. Step out from any meeting where you are not going to take any decision and you are not getting information you already don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://socratic-form-microscopy.com/2017/06/18/six-steps-to-a-daily-writing-habit/&quot;&gt;A great post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Zachary Jacobi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I recommend looking at Beeminder not as a tool to effectively guilt yourself into writing, but as a reminder of what writing is worth to you. You value consistently writing at $X. You know that every time you skip writing for a day or a week, there is a Y% chance that you might lose the habit. Multiply those two together and you get your ideal maximum Beeminder pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeminder.com/bizzz/pocket&quot;&gt;I use Beeminder&lt;/a&gt; to read up all of my pocketed articles.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometime in the past couple of years I’ve created a bad akrasia-like habit of pocketing articles that are too hard to read at that moment. “Imma read this funny small LJ post now and let future-Andrey handle that huge SSC post later”. I also used to add some neat posts that are useless to me (i.e. HN post about how to use ardruino and tensorflow to detect misoginy in Sillicon Valley). Thus I amassed hundreds of articles and tons of guilt.&lt;br /&gt;
Now, each time I add an article, a point is substracted; a point is added each time I finish one (automation through &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/pocket&quot;&gt;IFTTT snippets&lt;/a&gt;). In the last three months, I’ve ploughed through 150 articles, some 400 yet to go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="goal" /><category term="beeminder" /><summary type="html">How to use Beeminder for a daily habit of X.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You know how they say “Scratch a cynic, find a romantic”? Well, scratch an underachiever and find a hard worker afraid of disappointing herself. Both the cynic and the underachiever are afraid of sticking their necks out and becoming who they deeply, passionately want to become, for fear of looking stupid or failing. […] I’ll bet you’re not even an introvert at heart. You’re someone who wants to live out loud, share herself with the world, and stop overthinking and delaying and avoiding the pesky little tasks that make up a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder if I’m that romantic in hiding. While, indeed, I can be &lt;em&gt;skeptical&lt;/em&gt; about all this passion-speech, in the end Heather recommends much of the same approach that I currently support: experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Get a therapist. Experiment with schedules. Try on different behaviors for size. Get very organized (without piles of things on the floor). Try making new friends. Try vigorous exercise. Try leaving the house more. Try not leaving. Try writing your feelings down. Check in with your body when you do things that stress you out. Notice your feelings. Express your feelings. Be honest, be honest, be honest. Take notes.&lt;/p&gt;

The pursuit of happiness defines many parts of my life. Or should I say “happiness”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SquirrelInHell&lt;/em&gt; writes about an unbelievable problem that &lt;a href=&quot;https://squirrelinhell.blogspot.se/2017/12/happiness-is-chore.html&quot;&gt;Happiness Is a Chore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;See, the human activity you describe as “pursuing happiness” […] seems to be in the same category as other common activities such as “acquiring education”, “helping people”, “talking to friends” (or should I say “talking” to “friends”) and so on. Which is to say, people do them in a way which is outwardly convincing enough to allow everyone to keep up the social pretenses. This is way different from what you’d see people do if they actually cared. The simple matter of fact is that the human brain is a kludge, and people are puppets dancing on the strings of a mad puppetmaster. Almost anything they claim to be doing isn’t for real. This is true even when they themselves know about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is strongly related to &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/09/Why-dont-we-try-really-doing-things&quot;&gt;The Thing and the Symbolic Representation of The Thing&lt;/a&gt;. (Next quote is still from &lt;em&gt;SquirrelInHell&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[…] I enjoy and see great value in happiness when it happens, but when it doesn’t I only work on it grudgingly. It’s like with exercise, which is great but I’m rarely enthusiastic about starting it. The problem is not that I don’t value happiness enough. The problem is rather that there is no gut-level motivational gradient to get actual happiness. There are gradients for all sorts of things which are crappy, fake substitutes. […] But you still end up optimizing for them, because that’s what your brain does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;↑ This indeed, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3Hkpttb6WsJwr5WdF/happiness-is-a-chore#BP2j9rDHr9SqMjDh9&quot;&gt;one LW commenter points out&lt;/a&gt;, looks like akrasia. And will probably benefit from methods that are good against akrasia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related, SquirrelInHell’s site &lt;a href=&quot;http://bewelltuned.com/&quot;&gt;Be Well Tuned&lt;/a&gt; (“a very unusual guide to improving your brain and your life”). I’ve added it to my to-do list &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/tag/goal&quot;&gt;#goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After rereading through everything linked above, I see that, at this moment, I’m &lt;em&gt;focused&lt;/em&gt; on riding my hedonic treadmill, solving various optimization problems, and I’m &lt;strong&gt;not mindful&lt;/strong&gt; about it; also not happy. This is a tendency I have. After talking about it with my psychotherapist, I will experiment with making more unsctrutured time and enjoying it; also spending less time on hardcore goal-oriented activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="squirrelinhell" /><category term="goal" /><summary type="html">UPD This post rises some important questions, so I promote it from link-post to the index page for visibility.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The planning fallacy is that people think they can plan, ha ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While planning, and in need of &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; scenario, people instead think of &lt;em&gt;best-case scenario&lt;/em&gt;. (See the article for related studies.)&lt;br /&gt;
Now on to how to fix it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So there is a fairly reliable way to fix the planning fallacy, if you’re doing something broadly similar to a reference class of previous projects. Just ask how long similar projects have taken in the past, without considering any of the special properties of this project.  Better yet, ask an experienced outsider how long similar projects have taken.&lt;br /&gt;
You’ll get back an answer that sounds hideously long, and clearly reflects no understanding of the special reasons why this particular task will take less time. This answer is true.  Deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

“In the new world of on-demand everything, you’re either pampered, isolated royalty — or you’re a 21st century servant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click-bait false dichotomy aside, this is an interesting area to think about. Is the future of work looks like a bunch of APIs for people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can image it being quite dystopian: install an app, answer some questions about your abilities, qualifications, schedule, etc. and &lt;em&gt;poof&lt;/em&gt; your time is auto-magically assigned to be spent in the most efficient way (most cost-efficient way for the API-hubs companies, that is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extreme optimization also may look like little additions to your daily life: The App nudges you to buy extra ice-cream on your way home; when you are on a red light, another &lt;del&gt;drone&lt;/del&gt; App user comes up to you and takes the ice-cream. She’s going home herself but is making a small detour to deliver that ice-cream to the one that ordered it. That order was placed automatically too, after analyzing customer’s biometric and social graph data (ML model says: though breakup) and coming to a conclusion that to maximize LTV, this purchase was needed. It also may lead to a need for a fitness programme purchase later, but again, that’s just LTV maximizing, nothing personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, back to our totally different world and the article at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The luxuries usually afforded to one-percenters now stretch to the urban upper-middle class, or so the technology industry cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/8523.full&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Around the world, increases in wealth have produced an unintended consequence: a rising sense of time scarcity. We provide evidence that using money to buy time can provide a buffer against this time famine, thereby promoting happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also the gender angle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s the other side of this, the gender one. The errands being served up by the on-demand economy — cooking, cleaning, laundry, groceries, runs to the post office — all were all once, and in many places still are, the jobs of stay-at-home mothers. Even now, when women outnumber men in the formal workplace, they continue to bear the brunt of that invisible domestic work, often for many, many hours a week. So women — those who can afford it, at least — have the most to win from passing that load on to somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually pre-order food to work, and sometimes hire a cleaning service — it saves a lot of time indeed, and, as I start to have less free time, I increasingly value it. I’m thinking of outsourcing making my breakfast and dinner too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><summary type="html">Lauren Smiley about The Shut-In Economy “In the new world of on-demand everything, you’re either pampered, isolated royalty — or you’re a 21st century servant.”</summary></entry></feed>
