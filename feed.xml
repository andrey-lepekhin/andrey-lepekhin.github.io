&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8-hour sleep and daily routine ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditation and various cognitive habits ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Healthy food ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sport ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No stimulants ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rigorous work-life balance ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therapy, friends, commitment devices, etc. ✔&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing all this does indeed provide me with a higher baseline happiness&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Still, I’ve managed to fool myself into treating all living-in-the-moment advise&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as ‘a list of goals that undoubtedly &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; bring happiness when completed’.  I was too dependent on &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; of what happiness &lt;em&gt;should be&lt;/em&gt; and was ignoring what I really felt in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when, even after meticulous completion of todo-list items, I feel down for some reason. Maybe I wanted to accomplish more, maybe someone was a dick to me, maybe I was a dick to someone, maybe it’s just a mysterious hormone fluctuation.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes, all it takes to bring my mood up are compassion and &lt;em&gt;a permission&lt;/em&gt; to feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also times when I did a lot of prep work, read articles by bestselling authors and listened to podcasts, made a model of myself and a plan how to improve my life; discussed and validated this plan with other people. But when I start executing, it feels like a grind and leaves me unmotivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, I usually concluded that my plan is flawed and I need to improve it. Or I’m not following the plan well enough bacuse I’m a lazy asshole and I need to figure out how to motivate me first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent therapy helped me to get out of my bubble a little and understand that 
&lt;strong&gt;I didn’t give enough credit to the direct experience&lt;/strong&gt; and my actual (vs. best guess) feelings. It’s like I was learning to ride a bicycle only by reading some physics textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, the overanalysing type, it can take a while to understand. This doesn’t mean that planning and analysis are unnecessary, I will still do them. But I will err on the side of (validation through) action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can formulate the main thought as &lt;strong&gt;update your model with your actual experience; plan for raw experience inputs and corrections early and throughout the plan&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m applying this newly learned principle for my hobbies/vocations search: I’m searching for things to do besides my day job, and start with no idea of what I could be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before&lt;/strong&gt;: elaborate planning, with weighted criteria list based on my best approximation of what I like; using said list as a scoring method for a vast list of hobbies&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;After&lt;/strong&gt;: same plan scaffolding but the criteria list and their weights come from a direct experience of doing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with software methodologies, I see this idea as applying the lean concept. It’s like interating on an MVP instead of waiting for the waterfall to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all still very new, but it feels uncomfortable and right – the best kind of feeling, meaning I’m broadening my comfort zone. Anyway, I’ll see where this particular rabbit hole goes and will change the course if I don’t like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’ve logged my mood and activity during random parts of the day for more than a year now. This allows me to see correlations between my activities and mood. Maybe someday I will make a more thorough proof that there is indeed causation, but right now I’m comfortable being sure that, e.g. dancing and lifting weights reliably make me happy, and playing computer games makes me sad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is also something that I did not prioritize until recently: focusing on the process, not just the goals; or living in the day-to-day and enjoying it. Some other common ideas (e.g. “silence is golden”) were well internalized by me, but I’ve thoroughly missed the “live in the now, It’s all you’ve got” mantra. My guess is it’s because it goes against basic evolutionary goals of staying alive long enough to reproduce: you just don’t enjoy the sunset while the woods are dark and full of terrors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And a lot of my routines are just that - a construct to make me behave in a way that benefits me in the long term. I’ve even sometimes dreamt of teaming up and living with like-minded people: helping and pushing each other further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, The Zvi has written &lt;a href=&quot;https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/06/24/on-dragon-army/&quot;&gt;a huge piece discussing &lt;em&gt;the Dragon Army&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now I know that rationalist group houses exist and have been discussed &lt;em&gt;in length&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Dragon Army [Barracks]?&lt;/strong&gt;  It’s a high-commitment, high-standards, high-investment group house model with centralized leadership and an up-or-out participation norm, designed to a) improve its members and b) actually accomplish medium-to-large scale tasks requiring long-term coordination.  Tongue-in-cheek referred to as the “fascist/authoritarian take on rationalist housing,” which has no doubt contributed to my being vulnerable to strawmanning but was nevertheless the correct joke to be making, lest people misunderstand what they were signing up for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/p23/dragon_army_theory_charter_30min_read/&quot;&gt;the original post about Dragon Army&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Duncan Sabien&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
If you plan on doing something like that near Moscow, please call me up, I am better than average with discipline and no novice to levelling up in groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked Zvi’s thought that self-improvement shouldn’t be a goal in itself, but should have some other, primary goal to which self-improvement is an auxiliary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The problem is that in my experience, your &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; terminal goal can be self-improvement all you like, but unless you choose a different primary goal and work towards &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, you won’t self-improve all that much. The way you get better is because you need to get better &lt;em&gt;to do a thing&lt;/em&gt;. Otherwise it’s all, well, let’s let Duncan’s hero Tyler Durden explain:&lt;br /&gt;
[video]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is importantly true (although in a literal sense it is obviously false), and seems like the most obvious point of failure. Another is choosing Tyler’s solution to this problem. Don’t do that either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So yes, do all six of these things and have all three of these goals, but don’t think that down near the bottom of your list is doing a few concrete things every now and then. Everyone needs to have the thing, and have the thing be central and important to them, whatever the thing may be, and that person should then judge their success or failure on that basis, and the group also needs a big thing. Yes, we will also evaluate whether we hit the self-improvement marks, but on their own they simply do not cut it. Credit to my wife Laura Baur for making this point very clear and explicit to me, so that I realized its importance. Which is very high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The articles were designed to get attention, so please look past misused memes and click-baity headings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serge was also a CEO of a company I’m working for. While still a CEO, he did several seminars where he described his reasoning and methods behind (then called) life-optimization. I am one of the people that that was sold on the less-than-hardcore part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A qurterly blood panel of around 50 blood markers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation of strategies to change the markers that are not in the green (e.g. try supplements, change training routines, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eat less sugar. Switching from a lifetime consumption of the family-recipe homemade jam was hard at first, but now I actually enjoy how food tastes without any added sweetness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intermittent fasting protocol where I eat during 6-8 hours of a day, leaving the rest to fasting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the moment I experiment sleeping at the same times daily: going to bed before 22:00 and waking up at 06:30.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditate daily&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free weights exercise. I used to do HIIT, but paused as my main goal is gaining muscle at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I haven’t done yet but plan to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ketogenic diet for reported cognitive enhancements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prolonged fasting as a cancer prevention&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SSRIs and &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; drugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More sleep experiments (&lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; darkness, coolness, and optimal CO2) with help form some devices like oura ring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All-in-all, I do not see some overwhelming results, though I do benefit from my life being more structured, i.e. when I &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/01/Why-choices-are-bad&quot;&gt;don’t have to decide&lt;/a&gt; whether and when get out of bed, or what to eat today.&lt;br /&gt;
I view it all as a hobby that probably has some benefits of increasing my health and happiness. Also a handy conversation piece.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="biohacking" /><category term="goal" /><summary type="html">Serge Faguet is an entrepreneur that has written three long controversial articles on Hackernoon and revamped the term ‘biohacking’ for me.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">85 Things I learned being a CEO</title><link href="https://www.lepekhin.com/2018/05/20/85-things-i-learned-being-a-ceo" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="85 Things I learned being a CEO" /><published>2018-05-20T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2018-05-20T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>https://www.lepekhin.com/2018/05/20/85-things-i-learned-being-a-ceo</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lepekhin.com/2018/05/20/85-things-i-learned-being-a-ceo">&lt;p&gt;A Hackernoon &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/85-things-i-learned-being-a-ceo-4c25fc1c7b99&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;em&gt;Sachin Gupta&lt;/em&gt; details lessons from his CEO career in the areas of job’s key responsibilities, decision making, culture, leadership, self-management, people management, meetings, hiring, and fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the most relevant for me are these parts about meetings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Explicitly ask people if you are needed to be part of a meeting. Wherever you are needed, ask them for an agenda and also ask what is expected from you in the meeting. Else say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are only 2 types of meetings that you should attend — a) where you have to take a decision b) where you get updates/information. The productivity of the first depends solely on you and the latter on how you have trained your team. Step out from any meeting where you are not going to take any decision and you are not getting information you already don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://socratic-form-microscopy.com/2017/06/18/six-steps-to-a-daily-writing-habit/&quot;&gt;A great post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Zachary Jacobi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I recommend looking at Beeminder not as a tool to effectively guilt yourself into writing, but as a reminder of what writing is worth to you. You value consistently writing at $X. You know that every time you skip writing for a day or a week, there is a Y% chance that you might lose the habit. Multiply those two together and you get your ideal maximum Beeminder pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeminder.com/bizzz/pocket&quot;&gt;I use Beeminder&lt;/a&gt; to read up all of my pocketed articles.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometime in the past couple of years I’ve created a bad akrasia-like habit of pocketing articles that are too hard to read at that moment. “Imma read this funny small LJ post now and let future-Andrey handle that huge SSC post later”. I also used to add some neat posts that are useless to me (i.e. HN post about how to use ardruino and tensorflow to detect misoginy in Sillicon Valley). Thus I amassed hundreds of articles and tons of guilt.&lt;br /&gt;
Now, each time I add an article, a point is substracted; a point is added each time I finish one (automation through &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/pocket&quot;&gt;IFTTT snippets&lt;/a&gt;). In the last three months, I’ve ploughed through 150 articles, some 400 yet to go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="goal" /><category term="beeminder" /><summary type="html">How to use Beeminder for a daily habit of X.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You know how they say “Scratch a cynic, find a romantic”? Well, scratch an underachiever and find a hard worker afraid of disappointing herself. Both the cynic and the underachiever are afraid of sticking their necks out and becoming who they deeply, passionately want to become, for fear of looking stupid or failing. […] I’ll bet you’re not even an introvert at heart. You’re someone who wants to live out loud, share herself with the world, and stop overthinking and delaying and avoiding the pesky little tasks that make up a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder if I’m that romantic in hiding. While, indeed, I can be &lt;em&gt;skeptical&lt;/em&gt; about all this passion-speech, in the end Heather recommends much of the same approach that I currently support: experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Get a therapist. Experiment with schedules. Try on different behaviors for size. Get very organized (without piles of things on the floor). Try making new friends. Try vigorous exercise. Try leaving the house more. Try not leaving. Try writing your feelings down. Check in with your body when you do things that stress you out. Notice your feelings. Express your feelings. Be honest, be honest, be honest. Take notes.&lt;/p&gt;
