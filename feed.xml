&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You know how they say “Scratch a cynic, find a romantic”? Well, scratch an underachiever and find a hard worker afraid of disappointing herself. Both the cynic and the underachiever are afraid of sticking their necks out and becoming who they deeply, passionately want to become, for fear of looking stupid or failing. […] I’ll bet you’re not even an introvert at heart. You’re someone who wants to live out loud, share herself with the world, and stop overthinking and delaying and avoiding the pesky little tasks that make up a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder if I’m that romantic in hiding. While, indeed, I can be &lt;em&gt;skeptical&lt;/em&gt; about all this passion-speech, in the end Heather recommends much of the same approach that I currently support: experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Get a therapist. Experiment with schedules. Try on different behaviors for size. Get very organized (without piles of things on the floor). Try making new friends. Try vigorous exercise. Try leaving the house more. Try not leaving. Try writing your feelings down. Check in with your body when you do things that stress you out. Notice your feelings. Express your feelings. Be honest, be honest, be honest. Take notes.&lt;/p&gt;

The pursuit of happiness defines many parts of my life. Or should I say “happiness”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SquirrelInHell&lt;/em&gt; writes about an unbelievable problem that &lt;a href=&quot;https://squirrelinhell.blogspot.se/2017/12/happiness-is-chore.html&quot;&gt;Happiness Is a Chore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;See, the human activity you describe as “pursuing happiness” […] seems to be in the same category as other common activities such as “acquiring education”, “helping people”, “talking to friends” (or should I say “talking” to “friends”) and so on. Which is to say, people do them in a way which is outwardly convincing enough to allow everyone to keep up the social pretenses. This is way different from what you’d see people do if they actually cared. The simple matter of fact is that the human brain is a kludge, and people are puppets dancing on the strings of a mad puppetmaster. Almost anything they claim to be doing isn’t for real. This is true even when they themselves know about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is strongly related to &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/09/Why-dont-we-try-really-doing-things&quot;&gt;The Thing and the Symbolic Representation of The Thing&lt;/a&gt;. (Next quote is still from &lt;em&gt;SquirrelInHell&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[…] I enjoy and see great value in happiness when it happens, but when it doesn’t I only work on it grudgingly. It’s like with exercise, which is great but I’m rarely enthusiastic about starting it. The problem is not that I don’t value happiness enough. The problem is rather that there is no gut-level motivational gradient to get actual happiness. There are gradients for all sorts of things which are crappy, fake substitutes. […] But you still end up optimizing for them, because that’s what your brain does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;↑ This indeed, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3Hkpttb6WsJwr5WdF/happiness-is-a-chore#BP2j9rDHr9SqMjDh9&quot;&gt;one LW commenter points out&lt;/a&gt;, looks like akrasia. And will probably benefit from methods that are good against akrasia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related, SquirrelInHell’s site &lt;a href=&quot;http://bewelltuned.com/&quot;&gt;Be Well Tuned&lt;/a&gt; (“a very unusual guide to improving your brain and your life”). I’ve added it to my to-do list &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/tag/goal&quot;&gt;#goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After rereading through everything linked above, I see that, at this moment, I’m &lt;em&gt;focused&lt;/em&gt; on riding my hedonic treadmill, solving various optimization problems, and I’m &lt;strong&gt;not mindful&lt;/strong&gt; about it; also not happy. This is a tendency I have. After talking about it with my psychotherapist, I will experiment with making more unsctrutured time and enjoying it; also spending less time on hardcore goal-oriented activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="squirrelinhell" /><category term="goal" /><summary type="html">UPD This post rises some important questions, so I promote it from link-post to the index page for visibility.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The planning fallacy is that people think they can plan, ha ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While planning, and in need of &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; scenario, people instead think of &lt;em&gt;best-case scenario&lt;/em&gt;. (See the article for related studies.)&lt;br /&gt;
Now on to how to fix it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So there is a fairly reliable way to fix the planning fallacy, if you’re doing something broadly similar to a reference class of previous projects. Just ask how long similar projects have taken in the past, without considering any of the special properties of this project.  Better yet, ask an experienced outsider how long similar projects have taken.&lt;br /&gt;
You’ll get back an answer that sounds hideously long, and clearly reflects no understanding of the special reasons why this particular task will take less time. This answer is true.  Deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

“In the new world of on-demand everything, you’re either pampered, isolated royalty — or you’re a 21st century servant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click-bait false dichotomy aside, this is an interesting area to think about. Is the future of work looks like a bunch of APIs for people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can image it being quite dystopian: install an app, answer some questions about your abilities, qualifications, schedule, etc. and &lt;em&gt;poof&lt;/em&gt; your time is auto-magically assigned to be spent in the most efficient way (most cost-efficient way for the API-hubs companies, that is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extreme optimization also may look like little additions to your daily life: The App nudges you to buy extra ice-cream on your way home; when you are on a red light, another &lt;del&gt;drone&lt;/del&gt; App user comes up to you and takes the ice-cream. She’s going home herself but is making a small detour to deliver that ice-cream to the one that ordered it. That order was placed automatically too, after analyzing customer’s biometric and social graph data (ML model says: though breakup) and coming to a conclusion that to maximize LTV, this purchase was needed. It also may lead to a need for a fitness programme purchase later, but again, that’s just LTV maximizing, nothing personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, back to our totally different world and the article at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The luxuries usually afforded to one-percenters now stretch to the urban upper-middle class, or so the technology industry cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/8523.full&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Around the world, increases in wealth have produced an unintended consequence: a rising sense of time scarcity. We provide evidence that using money to buy time can provide a buffer against this time famine, thereby promoting happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also the gender angle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s the other side of this, the gender one. The errands being served up by the on-demand economy — cooking, cleaning, laundry, groceries, runs to the post office — all were all once, and in many places still are, the jobs of stay-at-home mothers. Even now, when women outnumber men in the formal workplace, they continue to bear the brunt of that invisible domestic work, often for many, many hours a week. So women — those who can afford it, at least — have the most to win from passing that load on to somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually pre-order food to work, and sometimes hire a cleaning service — it saves a lot of time indeed, and, as I start to have less free time, I increasingly value it. I’m thinking of outsourcing making my breakfast and dinner too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><summary type="html">Lauren Smiley about The Shut-In Economy “In the new world of on-demand everything, you’re either pampered, isolated royalty — or you’re a 21st century servant.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How successful people work less — and get more done</title><link href="http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/04/07/How-successful-people-work-less-and-get-more-done" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How successful people work less — and get more done" /><published>2018-04-07T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2018-04-07T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/04/07/How-successful-people-work-less-and-get-more-done</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/04/07/How-successful-people-work-less-and-get-more-done">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travis Bradberry&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/386166/how-successful-people-work-less-and-get-more-done/&quot;&gt;How successful people work less—and get more done&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Quite a diverse list of things, actually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They disconnect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/07/On-demand-everything&quot;&gt;minimize chores&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They reflect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They exercise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They pursue a passion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They spend quality time with family&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They schedule micro-adventures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They wake up at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They designate mornings as “me time”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They prepare for the upcoming week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;But most importantly, they attac&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the article for more details. This list is by no means scientific, I included it here as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/tag/goal/&quot;&gt;goal-reminder&lt;/a&gt;: I already do more than half of it, probably should look into what’s left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The study found that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that there’s no point in working any more. That’s right, people who work as much as 70 hours (or more) per week actually get the same amount done as people who work 55 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that they studied people productivity in &lt;em&gt;manufacturing&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. “Forty Women Milling a Screw Thread on Fuze Bodies”, I’m not sure how well it translates to creative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I grabbed this article and sent it to people who (I think) overwork. To which they countered that output of 55 hours is still bigger than that of 40 hours of work. Of course you have to pay the price, but still, if you’re willing and can do so sustainably, you really can get more done by working more than 8 hours a day (or without weekends).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="goal" /><summary type="html">Travis Bradberry on How successful people work less—and get more done Quite a diverse list of things, actually:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tony Robbins interview with Tim Ferriss - my takeaways</title><link href="http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/31/Tony-Robbins-interview-with-Tim-Ferriss-my-takeaways" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tony Robbins interview with Tim Ferriss - my takeaways" /><published>2018-03-31T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2018-03-31T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/31/Tony-Robbins-interview-with-Tim-Ferriss-my-takeaways</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/31/Tony-Robbins-interview-with-Tim-Ferriss-my-takeaways">&lt;p&gt;I’ve first heard Tony Robbins’ interviews sometime in 2016. I was fascinated: a great story-teller and he speaks about things that interest me — mood-states that affect behavior, and how to change your energy levels. Here are my takeaways from one of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Tony+Robbins+site%3Atim.blog&quot;&gt;interviews with Tim Ferriss&lt;/a&gt;. Each paragraph is a paraphrased quote from Tony followed by my comment in &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to give to prosper. Even if you think you don’t have enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is something I struggle with as it’s not obvious to me &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; I should divert resources from myself. I’m going to speak with effective altruists (EA) and try and get convinced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Number one quality to foster is staying hungry, this will bring others along. How to do it? Be among people who are successful. You are who you spend time with. To be happy you need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is also something that is hard for me - by default I don’t value friendship that much. At least I understand the logic here and I’m making progress: meeting new people and starting (non-romantic) relationships with them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Failure is a part of life. It doesn’t need to stop you. It’s a stepping stone to success, speed bump. I know I’m going to fail, but it’s not failure if you learn something. We don’t value what we don’t fight for. Like cheating in video games. There’s no such thing as effortless approach.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did have a belief along the lines of “life &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; be easy”. And that was (and still is sometimes) a source of discontent for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Money doesn’t change you, it magnifies what you already are.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is also why I think I should start donating now, and looks like that is what EA guys preach too (donate at least 1% to create a habit)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important decision in your life is deciding whether you’re truly committed to being happy no matter what. You will experience extreme stress, no matter what. Life’s too short to suffer. Decide to be in a beautiful state. &lt;strong&gt;This brain is not designed to make you happy, it’s designed to make you survive&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to work to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See also Tim Urban about &lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html&quot;&gt;Social Survival Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highest experiences in life have this in common: there is some growth within ourselves (face fear, overcome something, etc) and some contribution beyond ourselves.
Worst experiences are about only you. When you are suffering it’s because you’re obsessing about yourself. Something happened and you have less of something, or you lost something (love, money, significance, attention). Loss, less, never are the sources of suffering. All suffering is obsession with self. Snap out of your suffering. Stop expecting and start appreciating things outside of yourself: people, nature. You learn and grow from that. If you love, if you give, if you’re grateful - suffering disappears instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good a place to paste my favorite quote from a Haruki Murakami book cover: “Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in 2016 I’ve decided to attend one of Tony’s seminars to get some of that energy from the man himself. I attended UPW London 2017 and it was like a giant rave with applied psychology and lots of hugs. I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;
After I go through my notes, I’ll post my takeaways from there as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="goal" /><category term="tony-robbins" /><summary type="html">I’ve first heard Tony Robbins’ interviews sometime in 2016.

Each paragraph is a paraphrased quote from Tony followed by my comment in italics.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Religion, growth framework and enlightenment</title><link href="http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/25/Religion-growth-framework-and-enlightenment" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Religion, growth framework and enlightenment" /><published>2018-03-25T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2018-03-25T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/25/Religion-growth-framework-and-enlightenment</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/25/Religion-growth-framework-and-enlightenment">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim Urban&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html&quot;&gt;Religion for the Nonreligious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Like many of his great posts, this one is long. I’ve read it in 2015 when I was struggling to find my way around religion and it stroke a chord. &lt;em&gt;For me&lt;/em&gt;, it’s about two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-states-of-mind&quot;&gt;1. States of mind&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Engulfed in primitive, primal thoughts&lt;br /&gt;
(2) See things as they are, enlightenment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-creating-a-better-belief-system&quot;&gt;2. Creating a better belief system&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…smelted with a &lt;em&gt;growth framework&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Coincidentally, growth framework is something that I lacked in 2015. I now have a system in place, it’s still new and I’m not as religious about it as Tim. I will make a post about it after 1 year test-drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short quote&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m an atheist, but atheism isn’t a growth model any more than “I don’t like rollerblading” is a workout strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
