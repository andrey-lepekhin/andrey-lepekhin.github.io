I was fascinated: a great story-teller and he speaks about things that interest me — mood-states that affect behavior, and how to change your energy levels. Here are my takeaways from one of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Tony+Robbins+site%3Atim.blog&quot;&gt;interviews with Tim Ferriss&lt;/a&gt;. Each paragraph is a paraphrased quote from Tony followed by my comment in &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to give to prosper. Even if you think you don’t have enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is something I struggle with as it’s not obvious to me &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; I should divert resources from myself. I’m going to speak with effective altruists (EA) and try and get convinced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Number one quality to foster is staying hungry, this will bring others along. How to do it? Be among people who are successful. You are who you spend time with. To be happy you need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is also something that is hard for me - by default I don’t value friendship that much. At least I understand the logic here and I’m making progress: meeting new people and starting (non-romantic) relationships with them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Failure is a part of life. It doesn’t need to stop you. It’s a stepping stone to success, speed bump. I know I’m going to fail, but it’s not failure if you learn something. We don’t value what we don’t fight for. Like cheating in video games. There’s no such thing as effortless approach.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did have a belief along the lines of “life &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; be easy”. And that was (and still is sometimes) a source of discontent for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Money doesn’t change you, it magnifies what you already are.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is also why I think I should start donating now, and looks like that is what EA guys preach too (donate at least 1% to create a habit)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important decision in your life is deciding whether you’re truly committed to being happy no matter what. You will experience extreme stress, no matter what. Life’s too short to suffer. Decide to be in a beautiful state. &lt;strong&gt;This brain is not designed to make you happy, it’s designed to make you survive&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to work to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See also Tim Urban about &lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html&quot;&gt;Social Survival Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highest experiences in life have this in common: there is some growth within ourselves (face fear, overcome something, etc) and some contribution beyond ourselves.
Worst experiences are about only you. When you are suffering it’s because you’re obsessing about yourself. Something happened and you have less of something, or you lost something (love, money, significance, attention). Loss, less, never are the sources of suffering. All suffering is obsession with self. Snap out of your suffering. Stop expecting and start appreciating things outside of yourself: people, nature. You learn and grow from that. If you love, if you give, if you’re grateful - suffering disappears instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good a place to paste my favorite quote from a Haruki Murakami book cover: “Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in 2016 I’ve decided to attend one of Tony’s seminars to get some of that energy from the man himself. I attended UPW London 2017 and it was like a giant rave with applied psychology and lots of hugs. I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;
After I go through my notes, I’ll post my takeaways from there as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="goal" /><category term="tony-robbins" /><summary type="html">I’ve first heard Tony Robbins’ interviews sometime in 2016.

Like many of his great posts, this one is long. I’ve read it in 2015 when I was struggling to find my way around religion and it stroke a chord. &lt;em&gt;For me&lt;/em&gt;, it’s about two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-states-of-mind&quot;&gt;1. States of mind&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Engulfed in primitive, primal thoughts&lt;br /&gt;
(2) See things as they are, enlightenment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-creating-a-better-belief-system&quot;&gt;2. Creating a better belief system&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…smelted with a &lt;em&gt;growth framework&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Coincidentally, growth framework is something that I lacked in 2015. I now have a system in place, it’s still new and I’m not as religious about it as Tim. I will make a post about it after 1 year test-drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short quote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m an atheist, but atheism isn’t a growth model any more than “I don’t like rollerblading” is a workout strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To do things that are very difficult or “impossible”,&lt;br /&gt;
First you have to not run away.  That takes seconds.&lt;br /&gt;
Then you have to work.  That takes hours.&lt;br /&gt;
Then you have to stick at it.  That takes years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taking Children Seriously (TCS) is a rational, non-coercive philosophy of parenting and learning which says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;* The main goal of parenting is to help children learn.  
* Punishing doesn’t help with learning.  
* Reason helps everyone win.  
* Ignorance isn’t stupidity.  
* Children aren’t fragile.  
* Obedience and rules are bad.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like a great rational framework for parenting. Many ‘enable everything’ or ‘obedience is the only way’ ways of parenting just don’t sit well with me, this one does. 
It also underscores my existing belief that &lt;em&gt;parenting is hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of history, my current argument &lt;strong&gt;against having children&lt;/strong&gt; goes like this: &lt;br /&gt;
raising children requires a lot of time and this time commitment is at least for &lt;strong&gt;18.75 years&lt;/strong&gt;.
Anecdotal &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;it's worth it&lt;/code&gt; from the parents I know can really be some sort of Stockholm syndrome. I mean, if you have a child already and you don’t like it, you have the choice of suffering (bad for you and the child) or learning how to love it and make the best of the situation. Leaving a child looks like a heavy conscience penalty so it’s out of the consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please tell me if you have a counter to this line of thinking. It does look shaky and I definitely will need to do a full analysis of this question later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Here are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/16/bundles-of-joy/&quot;&gt;stats on life satisfaction depending on number of children from SSC&lt;/a&gt; (spoiler: more children - more satisfaction).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="parenting" /><summary type="html">Elliot Temple about Taking Children Seriously</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why it’s easy to start a subpar relationship</title><link href="http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/17/Why-its-easy-to-start-a-subpar-relationship" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why it's easy to start a subpar relationship" /><published>2018-03-17T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2018-03-17T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/17/Why-its-easy-to-start-a-subpar-relationship</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/17/Why-its-easy-to-start-a-subpar-relationship">&lt;p&gt;And what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s happening when I’m not in a relationship for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/images/2018-03-17-Why-its-easy-to-start-a-subpar-relationship-graph-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph 1, described in text below&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acceptable partner attractiveness (APA) is everything I seek for in a partner: physical beauty, personal qualities, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I am in a relationship, APA is at max level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a relationship ends, my APA lingers at max for a bit and then starts to lower.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After I start a new relationship, APA goes back to max levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problems&quot;&gt;Problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-becomes-harder-to-date-more-attractive-partners&quot;&gt;It becomes harder to date more attractive partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/images/scumbag_brain.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scumbag brain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primitive mind auto-applies dates’ &lt;em&gt;courting easiness&lt;/em&gt; labels based on &lt;em&gt;attractiveness&lt;/em&gt;. The less attractive the date, the easier it seems to court her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am programmed to do least possible amount work to achieve my goals so, if acting by default, I will court dates with lower perceived attractiveness because it seems like less work, and still gets acceptable result. &lt;strong&gt;Why try hard when easy’s good enough?&lt;/strong&gt; My amygdala doesn’t care that the result is only acceptable right in that moment and will become unacceptable soon after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-easier-to-begin-an-unacceptable-relationship&quot;&gt;It’s easier to begin an unacceptable relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s just me, but when you’re fresh out of a relationship, you don’t seem too eager to jump start a new one. But as the loneliness goes on, desire for &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; relationship grows.
&lt;strong&gt;So not only your requirements are lowered, you actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; being in a relationship more, exactly at the time when they are low&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/images/2018-03-17-Why-its-easy-to-start-a-subpar-relationship-graph-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph 2, yearning for a relationship grows with time&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yearning-for-relationship-correlates-with-easiness-of-starting-a-subpar-relationship-&quot;&gt;Yearning for relationship correlates with easiness of starting a subpar relationship :(&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the acceptable standard lowers, the pool of available partners grows and it’s easier to start a new relationship.
There would not be a problem if acceptable SO attractiveness didn’t rise to the max after that, but it does and the consequences are dire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in a relationship that doesn’t satisfy you sucks.
The internal conflict rises: should I stay or should I go? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN1WwnEDWAM&quot;&gt;♫&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s not an &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/01/Why-choices-are-bad&quot;&gt;easy choice&lt;/a&gt;, you have emotional attachment and a whole host of cognitive biases working against you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Wanting to stay in a relationship is reinforced by many biases (status quo bias, ambiguity effect, choice supportive bias, loss aversion, mere-exposure effect, ostrich effect). For someone to break through all those biases and end things, they must be extremely unhappy.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/m78/strategies_and_tools_for_getting_through_a_break/&quot;&gt;Strategies and tools for getting through a break up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more this draws on the more stakes are in opportunity cost and the more it becomes harder to break things apart. Some stay in this state of conflict throughout their whole lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worth mentioning: I am not an &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; idealist, I understand there can be compromises. Here I am speaking of cases when you can’t compromise after standards go up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-the-standards-fall&quot;&gt;Why do the standards fall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/images/2018-03-17-Why-its-easy-to-start-a-subpar-relationship-graph-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph 3, progression of acceptable partner attractiveness criteria for high (just after relationship) to low (just before starting a relationship) to high again&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that it’s a response to one of the basic needs not being met.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll try a metaphor. Imagine you do not have a place to sleep. In the morning you do not need to sleep so your idea of a place to sleep is a 5-star hotel. In the afternoon you become a little sleepier and make vague attempts on finding &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; hotel, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; hotel. In the evening you’re sleepy and really need a place to rest, and will agree on a capsule hotel or a hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it’s just evolution nudging: “Come on, stop thinking, just fuck whatever”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-the-standards-rise-again&quot;&gt;Why do the standards rise again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like a natural thing to happen after a bare minimum of a need is met.
In a place-to-sleep example above: after a night in a capsule hotel you do feel refreshed, but you also understand that you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; silence to sleep really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forewarned is forearmed. Just keeping this whole thing in mind helps me in some cases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve created and maintain my &lt;em&gt;partner criteria list&lt;/em&gt; and filter out my new dates under a threat of suffering (unsatisfactory relationship).&lt;br /&gt;
This doesn’t help with increased perceived difficultness of dating more attractive partners; I’m still searching a solution for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s solvable by sex without relationships?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friends with benefits - doesn’t work for me, as it usually grows into a relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One-night-stands - I didn’t have that many encounters so I cannot generalize. Probably should look into it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paying for sex (here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/biohack-your-intelligence-now-or-become-obsolete-97cdd15e395f&quot;&gt;Serge Faguet’s take on it&lt;/a&gt;) - same as above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I miss?&lt;/strong&gt; How do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; solve this problem? Please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/about#contact-me&quot;&gt;share&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number 8 will &lt;em&gt;blow your mind&lt;/em&gt;! Just kidding. But seriously, I’ll quote the ones that apply to me the most:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2) I never regret working out. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;10) The quickest and most reliable path to personal improvement is to do the things on my list that I resist most. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;11) All you need to do to finish things is keep starting them until they’re done. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;14) The most consistently joyful activities for me are visiting with other people and reading books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending most of my life preferring various solitary entertainments to &lt;em&gt;socializing&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve recently came to similar understanding about meeting other people. It seems to energize me and fill me with joy (self-reported mood data supports it). The trick is to find like-minded people. Maybe I’ll write a post about it sometime - it was a very big change in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><summary type="html">David Cain about things that he knows are good for him but he still only does them seldomly.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Web comic</title><link href="http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/10/Web-comic" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Web comic" /><published>2018-03-10T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2018-03-10T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/10/Web-comic</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.lepekhin.com/2018/03/10/Web-comic">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/479/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://extrafabulouscomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-e1520299525393.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/02/24/Hello-world&quot;&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;link-posts&quot;&gt;Link-posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/category/links/&quot;&gt;Links to articles, posts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/category/comics/&quot;&gt;webcomics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/tag/video/&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt;, etc
— are not included in the general blog roll in the root of this blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Satisfy the sharing need: when I find something thought-provoking I get a craving to share it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn something better by explaining it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a link into my Pocket mainly from: Hacker News and other IT-infused sources, friends, colleagues or RSS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read it. If I find some parts that 1) are interesting new information, and 2) probably will improve my life if applied — I share those parts with myself via email.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once in a blue moon I read through such emails and weed out things that are no longer interesting. Maybe it seemed useful and now does not, or maybe I was trying to be trendy and now I see though my past-self. Time buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I still feel like that info is useful, I then create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/category/links/&quot;&gt;link-post&lt;/a&gt; with a small description and key quotes so that future-me (and you, dear reader) can get to the point faster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO&lt;/strong&gt; Schedule re-reading of old posts or make an anki-like thing to remember and use practical parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-blog-posts&quot;&gt;General blog posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— the default type of posts that you see in the root if this blog&lt;br /&gt;
General blog posts are almost the same as link-posts above but I feel a lot more strongly about sharing these: their perceived importance is high. Also they tend to contain more text written by yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-goals&quot;&gt;More Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting more writing experience for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the skill of getting my point across &lt;em&gt;quicker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;affecting more people than usual (that is &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; I make a goal out of making this blog popular in the future)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creating a thought-archive which I can analyze, and improve upon my thought processes. I think that the ability to write down thoughts is the first major artificial brain augmentation; it would be a shame not to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;process-1&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as for link-posts, but more time-consuming. Also, sometimes I have original ideas whereas link-post are usually just my interpretation of someone else’s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will update this post if I change the process or the goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="goal" /><category term="process" /><summary type="html">I describe my processes for writing here and the goals behind those processes.

I do recommend reading all three posts, it was a feel-good delta knowledge for me. Here I will focus on ‘More Dakka’ which expands on why we do not try seemingly obvious solutions, or attempt and never finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People express gratitude. We are told it improves subjective well-being in studies. Our subjective well-being improves a little. We could express more gratitude, with no real downsides. Almost all of us don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If something is a good idea, you need a reason to not try doing more of it. No, seriously. You need a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;do more of what is already working and see if it works more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing &lt;em&gt;the Thing&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;the Symbolic Representation of The Thing&lt;/em&gt; is harder because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You need to realize the thing might exist at all.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You need to realize the symbolic representation of the thing isn’t the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You need to ignore the idea that you’ve done your job.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You need to actually care about solving the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You need to think about the problem a little.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You need to ignore the idea that no one could blame you for not trying.&lt;br /&gt;
[…]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then he explains each one in more detail. It looks like a bunch of small inconveniences that together form a learned helplessness buffer that prevents any actual work getting done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Something possibly being slightly socially awkward, or causing a likely nominal failure, acts as a veto. Rationalizations for this are created as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some such worries are real. […] But they’re mostly trying to halt thinking about the object level, to keep you from being the nail that sticks up and gets hammered down. When someone else raises them, mostly &lt;strong&gt;they’re the hammer&lt;/strong&gt;. The fears are mirages we’ve been trained and built to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;↑ This is one of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lepekhin.com/tag/goal&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt;: Getting to the object level, asking ‘why?’ and ‘what can be done to overcome this obstacle?’ until &lt;em&gt;the Thing&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="the-zvi" /><category term="delta" /><category term="goal" /><summary type="html">‘More Dakka’ by Zvi starts as a review on Eliezer Yudkowsky’s book Inadequate Eqilibria, and then turns to apply ideas of The Thing and the Symbolic Representation of The Thing by Zvi, and Scott Alexander’s Concept-Shaped Holes Can Be Impossible To Notice to expand on whys and hows of the problem that I can only vaguely name as “Why don’t we try really doing things”.
