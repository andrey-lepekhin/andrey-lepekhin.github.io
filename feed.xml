This post is for people who live in a metropolitan area, have enough income to rent a place for themselves (with flatmates if needed), don’t have commitments that prohibit them from moving and, most importantly, are &lt;strong&gt;not satisfied with their commute time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to describe why I came to a decision to rent a pricey apartment downtown. This is part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/tag/renting/&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; where I share my tools and thinking processes towards renting: from changing your mindset to apartment research to communication with your landlord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rationale&quot;&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every extra minute of commute time reduces job satisfaction, reduces leisure time satisfaction, increases strain and reduces mental health.&lt;br /&gt;
[…]&lt;br /&gt;
An additional 10 minutes (each way) of commuting time is associated with the equivalent effect on job satisfaction as a 19% reduction in gross personal income.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travelbehaviour.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/caw-summaryreport-onlineedition.pdf&quot;&gt;Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think of my 1h 10m (each way) commute as a needed tribute to adult values, something most of my college friends did (sometimes with much longer travel times), something inescapable. But studies similar to the one cited above and my own happiness being affected due to the mediocre use of these precious hours brought me to a realization: I want to live closer to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-thrifty-can-be-an-issue&quot;&gt;Being thrifty can be an issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one problem though — it was prohibitively expensive. Technically, I could afford it, but habituated with cheap living while spending less than half of my income, I just could not justify such an expense. The thought of the yearly cost of rent in the city filled my frugal self with outrage. &lt;em&gt;That’s an unfair price!&lt;/em&gt; — I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could I be wrong? What if those hours spent commuting really are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; valuable than even such a sizeable chunk of money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/05/reclaim-your-commute&quot;&gt;2017 article published in &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers discussed the results of a study they conducted where they asked subjects to choose between two jobs:&lt;br /&gt;
●	Job #1 had a 50-minute round-trip commute and paid $67,000 a year.&lt;br /&gt;
●	Job #2 had a 20-minute round-trip commute and paid $64,000 a year.&lt;br /&gt;
84% of the participants in the study selected job #1, as researchers wrote, “expressing a willingness to forfeit one hour each workday to their commute—250 hours per year—in exchange for just $3,000. That’s $12 an hour of commuting time—less than half their hourly rate at work!”&lt;br /&gt;
They concluded that people were unable to “fully appreciate the psychological, emotional, and physical costs of longer travel times.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90381845/how-to-make-your-long-commute-less-stressful&quot;&gt;How to make your long commute less stressful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how to overcome this bias and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measure-an-adequate-cost-of-time-spent-commuting&quot;&gt;Measure an adequate cost of time spent commuting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first approach was to answer a hypothetical like: “&lt;em&gt;After 9 hours at work, Mr. Burns wants me to do some menial work for another hour. How much does he have to pay for me to be satisfied with this hour?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;br /&gt;
That provided an amount of 12 000 ₽&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as a result. I had to revise the question immediately as the real situation was not so one-sided:&lt;br /&gt;
I enjoy reading on the tube, and I don’t mind a brisk walk of up to 20 minutes. So, the question had to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out I was already asking myself a useful question before every Uber drive: “Am I willing to pay this amount for speed and comfort instead of using public transport?” &lt;br /&gt;
With that, I realized a better question to ask before commuting is: “&lt;strong&gt;How much am I willing to pay right now to be home/at work in 20 minutes?&lt;/strong&gt;” I answered this question every day for two weeks and got a variety of results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2019-11-26-table-how-much-to-fly-to-work.png&quot; alt=&quot;The table with varying answers for each morning and evening of 10 weekdays, with median calculated as 1350 rub.&quot; /&gt;
Some days I dreaded the tube, and some days it was more… acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median price I was willing to pay per 50 commute-free minutes was nine times lower than the sum that my initial question provided. That’s 1350*60/50 = 1620 ₽ per hour of commute time saved. That applies to work days only, so to compare apples with apples, I’ll smear that number throughout an average month = 1620*22/30 = 1188 ₽. Let’s see what it will get me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2019-11-26-Moscow_rent_cost_map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Heat map of rent prices of Moscow. Higher prices in city center&quot; /&gt;
The price of renting is higher the closer you are to downtown, which is filled with offices and historic places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a table to calculate the daily cost of time saved on commuting and the daily cost of rent in the corresponding neighborhoods&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2019-11-26-table-daily-rent-vs-cost-of-saved-time.png&quot; alt=&quot;The table which shows said calculations. Daily cost of saved free time minus cost of rent in the area of 20 minutes commute is positive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positive numbers in the last column mean that the price I’m willing to pay for a lesser commute is higher than the rent cost in the area that will provide said commute. What do you know, my frugal self &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; afford to live closer to the office! :tada:&lt;br /&gt;
…And that’s not even counting the opportunity costs of a long commute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, making a decision is easy, I’m going to rent downtown!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The next post is about how to approach selecting a neighborhood within an acceptable distance from your office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That’s around $200. Hereafter, prices will be in Rubles since I’m in Moscow, but it shouldn’t matter. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are two important assumptions made for simplification here: 1) These two weeks are not outliers 2) Each minute of commute costs exactly the same. That’s somehow irrelevant as the equilibrium between daily rent and the cost of saved time was achieved exactly at the 20-minute mark - the time I asked about in the previous question. Happy coincidence. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Something that has also helped my paradigm shift and start this whole process was an honest acceptance of the fact that yes, rent is expensive, it may not seem fair, but it’s a seller’s market and my outrage will not change this one bit. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes in length describing the case where eBay stopped paying $20mln annually for buying brand-name search ads from Google and did not see any visitors decrease. Then finishes with 13 studies of Facebook ad campaigns, in 10 of which the vast majority of sales increases were attributed to selection effect (e.g. customers were already looking for Nike shoes but went to nike.com through a Google ad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Advertising rationally, the way it’s described in economic textbooks, is unattainable. Then how do advertisers know what they ought to pay for ads?&lt;br /&gt;
“Yeah, basically they don’t know,” Lewis said in one of those throw-away clauses that kept running through my head for days after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article stops there, but I’ll have to argue that most of the examples apply to big brand companies. While a startup with a proven niche and known unit economics can and should still benefit from ads. Just not the brand-name ones, but the ones that help a user to discover their service (e.g. ‘cooked meals delivery’).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><summary type="html">Or as Jesse Frederik and Maurits Martijn named it The new dot com bubble is here: it’s called online advertising .</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">OpenAI language model is about to change how we parse meaningless text</title><link href="https://www.lepekhin.com/2019/02/26/OpenAI-language-model-is-about-to-change-how-we-parse-meaningless-text" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OpenAI language model is about to change how we parse meaningless text" /><published>2019-02-26T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2019-02-26T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>https://www.lepekhin.com/2019/02/26/OpenAI-language-model-is-about-to-change-how-we-parse-meaningless-text</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lepekhin.com/2019/02/26/OpenAI-language-model-is-about-to-change-how-we-parse-meaningless-text">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2019/02/25/humans-who-are-not-concentrating-are-not-general-intelligences/&quot;&gt;Humans Who Are Not Concentrating Are Not General Intelligences&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;em&gt;srconstantin&lt;/em&gt; describes one of many possible consequences of OpenAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/&quot;&gt;new language model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The mental motion of “I didn’t really parse that paragraph, but sure, whatever, I’ll take the author’s word for it” is, in my introspective experience, absolutely identical to “I didn’t really parse that paragraph because it was bot-generated and didn’t make any sense so I couldn’t possibly have parsed it”, except that in the first case, I assume that the error lies with me rather than the text.  This is not a safe assumption in a post-GPT2 world. Instead of “default to humility” (assume that when you don’t understand a passage, the passage is true and you’re just missing something) the ideal mental action in a world full of bots is “default to null” (if you don’t understand a passage, assume you’re in the same epistemic state as if you’d never read it at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on this topic, I’ll add two possible applications for GPT-2 successors that I see emerging in the next couple of years: 1) ‘Get-a-date Tinder chatbot’ and 2) ‘Witty chat messages suggestions’ in major chat apps.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="ai" /><category term="openai" /><summary type="html">Humans Who Are Not Concentrating Are Not General Intelligences in which srconstantin describes one of many possible consequences of OpenAI’s new language model.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Huge productivity gains</title><link href="https://www.lepekhin.com/2018/07/29/Huge-productivity-gains" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Huge productivity gains" /><published>2018-07-29T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2018-07-29T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>https://www.lepekhin.com/2018/07/29/Huge-productivity-gains</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lepekhin.com/2018/07/29/Huge-productivity-gains">&lt;p&gt;This is how I got &lt;strong&gt;the biggest increase in productivity&lt;/strong&gt; in the last 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is from this article: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.complice.co/post/121559734412/how-to-start-on-the-most-important-thing-every-day&quot;&gt;How to start on the most important thing every day&lt;/a&gt; by Malcolm Ocean (thanks, man!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to emphasize that this is the most valuable habit I have, by a large margin (and I’ve got some good ones!). Therefore if you’re reading this, I think that it’s at least worth &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to create a similar system in your own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I second Malcolm here, go read the article, I’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the new norm now, but you wouldn’t &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; how big this change was for me at the time. The difference was night and day, I wouldn’t stop telling my friends about it! Ok, if you’re sold, read on for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-impelentation&quot;&gt;My impelentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evening&lt;/strong&gt;, 2 hours before the sleep time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write down the plan for the next morning, including one most important goal, and optional hints like “start the going out routine by 8:00, leave home by 8:30”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning&lt;/strong&gt;, immediately after waking up&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At least one pomodoro doing the most important task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before breaking for any less productive activities like eating, Reddit or email checking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dance to at least one track&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, immediately followed by&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditate for at least 10 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-didnt-work&quot;&gt;What didn’t work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;planning-right-before-bed&quot;&gt;Planning right before bed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to plan the next morning before going to bed, but as I was very sleepy, plans that came out were poor. Now I plan 2 hours before bed time, when I’m more lucid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;doing-things-that-look-like-procrastinating&quot;&gt;Doing things that &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like procrastinating&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g. one time I was looking for a flat to rent and that was my main task for some weeks. Problem is, browsing listings, looking at a lot of pictures, is similar to my relaxation habit of browsing Reddit. After I finished looking through new listings, I noticed that it is super easy to slip into Reddit. I started scheduling my flat search later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;planning-my-day-as-the-first-task&quot;&gt;Planning my day as the first task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After initial success, I drifted toward “plan my whole day and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; start that important task”. Didn’t work so well. While planning a day, I usually encountered a small task: “Aha, easy 3-minute win! GTD prepared me for this! I just have to start this Slack conversation to update this status”. Then inevitably I’m replaying to other messages, it’s 15 minutes later and the productive mood is gone. &lt;strong&gt;Ok, it’s Slack rant time!&lt;/strong&gt; (I wanted to move it to another post, but, well, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; productivity related) If you want, you can stop reading now, this is the last part of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slack-rant&quot;&gt;Slack rant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replying to Slack messages &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; productive, but it is a very, &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; addictive way to procrastinate. It’s hard to say no to it. Others are replying fast. Instant messaging creates &lt;em&gt;expectation&lt;/em&gt; of a fast answer. It’s not your grandpa’s email after all. It is gratifying, it is a quick fix, it’s easy. Get your dopamine hit &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, it feels good having answered all unread messages. No anxiety. Bliss. Yet the faster you reply, the faster you get another message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no real multitasking for humans. You have to decide whether you want to have a state of flow or allow constant interruptions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not plunging into this infinite pseudo-productive sea of quick-fixes is something that is still hard for me. I don’t have new message notifications of course, but I know that red unread messages counter exists and it beckons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counter-measures&quot;&gt;Counter-measures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I lobby for not-expecting-an-immediate-answer culture when I can&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slack is hidden in the tray or turned off&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; not to mark messages as unread. This is still hard. Otherwise, I read a message, decide I don’t want to answer now, mark it unread… and one hour later the cycle repeats, eating away my time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to answer slack messages in bulk at scheduled unproductive times of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I start working at home, with no distractions, no phone, no Slack, no email.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is one thing that really helps me with slackrastination (that is a word now), or any procrastination for that matter: instead of automatically changing what you do, you make the process as conscious as possible. For me the good example are weeks when I track my time. Each time I change what I do, I write the new activity down and start corresponding activity timer&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. When I am in a state of flow and start writing “Slack” to change timers, I usually catch myself and go back to doing the important stuff.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Some mornings I am groggier than on others, that’s where having a clear todo list from the evening before shines – I don’t need to deliberate about what to do, no decision necessary. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Why? Dancing consistently makes me happy. Sometimes it’s 3 minutes, sometimes it will be 20. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me started on open space offices, I have one rant per post policy. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://toggl.com/&quot;&gt;Toggl&lt;/a&gt; for that. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve started seeing a new subcurrent of information that is communicated wordlessly (like body language). Now, it is so much more interesting to pay attention to and participate in this dance. What are they signaling? Did the interlocutor notice your move?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/look-em-in-the-eye-part-ii-how-to-make-eye-contact-the-right-way-in-life-business-and-love/&quot;&gt;How to Make Eye Contact the Right Way in Life, Business, and Love&lt;/a&gt; by Brett &amp;amp; Kate McKay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time, I’ve been mindful about my own eye contact during various forms of communication. But I never did the next step — treat and interpret the variety of possible eye contacts as the signals they are. We’re hardwired to interpret eye contact as a signal to answer questions like are you interested or not, are you submissive or dominant, are you trustworthy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in some contexts, I just took notice that “it’s uncomfortable to hold that gaze” and concluded “I’ll look at the table instead”. After reading this article, I started making the next step of assessing the situation: “…which could be interpreted as me signaling lower status”. After that I can choose whether that is something I want to happen right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having predetermined etiquette for expressing interest in the opposite sex is also very handy. In the past, after meeting a woman’s gaze several times I usually started thinking “Does it mean anything, or is it a coincidence? Should I go say hi now or wait a couple of minutes to be sure?”. The article conveniently answers these questions and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you look over at a woman, she will usually look away, whether she’s interested in you or not. But the way in which she averts her gaze tells you a lot about whether she wants you to approach her or not […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not paste more quotes, the article is small and neatly divided with subheadings so you can take only what you need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General guidelines on how to do it. When to look, where to look, how long, how to avert your gaze and what does it signal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sales and pitching (job interviews included)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you need to intimidate/dominate or diffuse a conflict&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meeting the eyes of a stranger in the street&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making eye contact with a woman&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When giving a speech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I started paying attention and &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; my eye contact behavior rather than &lt;em&gt;reacting&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve became more confident in almost all of those situations. And confidence feels great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else might I be missing? I’m sure there are more nuances to communication than I know of, after all &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/07/concept-shaped-holes-can-be-impossible-to-notice/&quot;&gt;Concept-Shaped Holes Can Be Impossible To Notice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/about#contact-me&quot;&gt;Drop me a line&lt;/a&gt; if you have something in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="goal" /><summary type="html">I’m amazed that I’ve only learned about this in my thirties.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8-hour sleep and daily routine ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditation and various cognitive habits ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Healthy food ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sport ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No stimulants ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rigorous work-life balance ✔&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therapy, friends, commitment devices, etc. ✔&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing all this does indeed provide me with a higher baseline happiness&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Still, I’ve managed to fool myself into treating all &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/07/01/Living-in-the-now&quot;&gt;living-in-the-moment advise&lt;/a&gt; as ‘a list of goals that undoubtedly &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; bring happiness when completed’.  I was too dependent on &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; of what happiness &lt;em&gt;should be&lt;/em&gt; and was ignoring what I really felt in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when, even after meticulous completion of todo-list items, I feel down for some reason. Maybe I wanted to accomplish more, maybe someone was a dick to me, maybe I was a dick to someone, maybe it’s just a mysterious hormone fluctuation.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes, all it takes to bring my mood up are compassion and &lt;em&gt;a permission&lt;/em&gt; to feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also times when I did a lot of prep work, read articles by bestselling authors and listened to podcasts, made a model of myself and a plan how to improve my life; discussed and validated this plan with other people. But when I start executing, it feels like a grind, leaves me unmotivated with not much to show for my effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, I usually concluded that my plan is flawed and I need to improve it. Or I’m not following the plan well enough because I’m a lazy asshole and I need to figure out how to motivate me first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent therapy helped me to get out of my bubble a little and understand that 
&lt;strong&gt;I didn’t give enough credit to the direct experience&lt;/strong&gt; and my actual (vs. best guess) feelings. It’s like I was learning to ride a bicycle only by reading some physics textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, the overanalysing type, it can take a while to understand. This doesn’t mean that planning and analysis are unnecessary, I will still do them. But I will err on the side of (validation through) action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can formulate the main thought as &lt;strong&gt;update your model with your actual experience; plan for raw experience inputs and corrections early and throughout the plan&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m applying this newly learned principle for my hobbies/vocations search: I’m searching for things to do besides my day job, and start with no idea of what I could be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before&lt;/strong&gt;: elaborate planning, with weighted criteria list based on my best approximation of what I like; using said list as a scoring method for a vast list of hobbies&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;After&lt;/strong&gt;: same plan scaffolding but the criteria list and their weights come from a direct experience of doing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with software methodologies, I see this idea as applying the lean concept. It’s like iterating on an MVP instead of waiting for the waterfall to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all still very new, but it feels uncomfortable and right – the best kind of feeling, meaning I’m broadening my comfort zone. Anyway, I’ll see where this particular rabbit hole goes and will change the course if I don’t like it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I’ve logged my mood and activity during random parts of the day for more than a year now. This allows me to see correlations between my activities and mood. Maybe someday I will make a more thorough proof that there is indeed causation, but right now I’m comfortable being sure that, e.g. dancing and lifting weights reliably make me happy, and playing computer games makes me sad. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some other common ideas (e.g. “silence is golden”) were well understood by me during adolescence, but the “live in the now, it’s all you’ve got” mantra was as elusive as it is ubiquitous&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the quotes from two great articles that clarify this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/ideas/how-schopenhauers-thought-can-illuminate-a-midlife-crisis&quot;&gt;How Schopenhauer’s thought can illuminate a midlife crisis&lt;/a&gt; by Kieran Setiya:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hence one common figure of the midlife crisis: the striving high-achiever, obsessed with getting things done, who is haunted by the hollowness of everyday life. When you are obsessed with projects, ceaselessly replacing old with new, satisfaction is always in the future. Or the past. It is mortgaged, then archived, but never possessed. In pursuing goals, you aim at outcomes that preclude the possibility of that pursuit, extinguishing the sparks of meaning in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the crisis diagnosed by Schopenhauer turns on excessive investment in projects, then the solution is to invest more fully in the process, giving meaning to your life through activities that have no terminal point: since they cannot be completed, your engagement with them is not exhaustive. It will not subvert itself. Nor does it invite the sense of frustration that Schopenhauer scorns in unsatisfied desire – the sense of being at a distance from one’s goal, so that fulfilment is always in the future or the past.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We should not give up on our worthwhile goals. Their achievement matters. But we should meditate, too, on the value of the process. It is no accident that the young and the old are generally more satisfied with life than those in middle age. Young adults have not embarked on life-defining projects; the aged have such accomplishments behind them. That makes it more natural for them to live in the present: to find value in atelic activities that are not exhausted by engagement or deferred to the future, but realised here and now. It is hard to resist the tyranny of projects in midlife, to find a balance between the telic and atelic. But if we hope to overcome the midlife crisis, to escape the gloom of emptiness and self-defeat, that is what we have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html&quot;&gt;Life is a Picture, But You Live in a Pixel&lt;/a&gt; by Tim Urban:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jack’s difficulties also relate to The Pixel Theory, a phrase coined by Tim Urban during his famous “alone in his apartment in front of the mirror” TED Talk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Jack sees his life as a rich picture depicting an epic story and assumes that the key to his happiness lies in the broad components of the image.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But this is a mistake, because Jack doesn’t live in the picture’s broad strokes, he lives at all times in a single pixel of the image—a single Today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So while thousands of Jack’s Todays will, to an outsider from far away, begin to look like a complete picture, Jack spends each moment of his actual reality in one unremarkable Today pixel or another. Jack’s error is brushing off his mundane Wednesday and focusing entirely on the big picture, when in fact the mundane Wednesday is the experience of his actual life.&lt;br /&gt;
And his assumption that his future Todays would be as vibrant and rich as the broad picture of his life is misunderstanding the unremarkable nature of a pixel, no matter what one’s life looks like in broad strokes. This assumption leads Jack to feel like his uneventful Today must be an unsatisfactory temporary relationship, when in reality it’s an inevitable and permanent marriage that he must accept and embrace in order to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As far as what will actually make Jack happier as he lives in his mundane Wednesday, there are a number of scientifically proven things, including spending time with people you like, sleeping well and exercising, doing things you’re good at, and doing kind things for others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But perhaps the first thing Jack needs to do is learn to feel more gratitude, another scientifically proven route to happiness and the area in which he falls the most woefully short. Jack spends so much of his time looking up at the great things that will come his way and planning his future happiness and not nearly enough time looking down and thinking about how badly he used to want so many of the things he currently has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;My guess it’s because it goes against basic evolutionary goals of staying alive long enough to reproduce: you just don’t enjoy the sunset while the woods are dark and full of terrors. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And a lot of my routines are just that - a construct to make me behave in a way that benefits me in the long term. I’ve even sometimes dreamt of teaming up and living with like-minded people: helping and pushing each other further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, The Zvi has written &lt;a href=&quot;https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/06/24/on-dragon-army/&quot;&gt;a huge piece discussing &lt;em&gt;the Dragon Army&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now I know that rationalist group houses exist and have been discussed &lt;em&gt;in length&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Dragon Army [Barracks]?&lt;/strong&gt;  It’s a high-commitment, high-standards, high-investment group house model with centralized leadership and an up-or-out participation norm, designed to a) improve its members and b) actually accomplish medium-to-large scale tasks requiring long-term coordination.  Tongue-in-cheek referred to as the “fascist/authoritarian take on rationalist housing,” which has no doubt contributed to my being vulnerable to strawmanning but was nevertheless the correct joke to be making, lest people misunderstand what they were signing up for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/p23/dragon_army_theory_charter_30min_read/&quot;&gt;the original post about Dragon Army&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Duncan Sabien&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
If you plan on doing something like that near Moscow, please call me up, I am better than average with discipline and no novice to levelling up in groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked Zvi’s thought that self-improvement shouldn’t be a goal in itself, but should have some other, primary goal to which self-improvement is an auxiliary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The problem is that in my experience, your &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; terminal goal can be self-improvement all you like, but unless you choose a different primary goal and work towards &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, you won’t self-improve all that much. The way you get better is because you need to get better &lt;em&gt;to do a thing&lt;/em&gt;. Otherwise it’s all, well, let’s let Duncan’s hero Tyler Durden explain:&lt;br /&gt;
[video]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is importantly true (although in a literal sense it is obviously false), and seems like the most obvious point of failure. Another is choosing Tyler’s solution to this problem. Don’t do that either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So yes, do all six of these things and have all three of these goals, but don’t think that down near the bottom of your list is doing a few concrete things every now and then. Everyone needs to have the thing, and have the thing be central and important to them, whatever the thing may be, and that person should then judge their success or failure on that basis, and the group also needs a big thing. Yes, we will also evaluate whether we hit the self-improvement marks, but on their own they simply do not cut it. Credit to my wife Laura Baur for making this point very clear and explicit to me, so that I realized its importance. Which is very high.&lt;/p&gt;
