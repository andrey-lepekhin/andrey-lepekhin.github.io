He told me that, ideally, I should wake up like Mickey Mouse: bright, energetic, and ready to leap out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-pseudo-Mickey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Animated mouse waking up, looking chipper. Generated by ChatGPT.&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Legally distinct, chipper morning mouse.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about my own mornings. The reality was a slow, groggy 30-minute crawl out of sleep. Mickey Mouse? I was more like a grumpy bear waking up from a long hibernation&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day, the ventilation failed in my office. After a few hours in the stuffy air, I had the exact same groggy feeling and a splitting headache. The pieces clicked into place. My office felt just like my bedroom in the morning. The enemy was CO2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bedroom was the perfect trap. As a light sleeper in the city, I seal it for silence. The window is closed to block out seagulls, and the door is shut to mute the rest of the apartment. Ventilation-wise my room has only a “trickle vent” – a small slit above the window to suck in fresh air based on pressure difference. But it didn’t feel like it was enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, a new obsession was born. I have a habit of looking for a “silver bullet”, a single fix that I believe will solve &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. If I could just lower the CO2 in my bedroom, I’d be more productive, make better decisions, and be happier. These waves of inspiration are my favorite part of any project. The bullet never solves all the problems, but the process is usually worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was time to build a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measuring-the-problem&quot;&gt;Measuring the Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I could solve the problem, I had to measure it. I remembered &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28457135&quot;&gt;a Hacker News post&lt;/a&gt; about a DIY CO2 monitor and ordered the parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My soldering skills were rusty, so a helpful stranger at the local maker space coached me through pin soldering without frying the sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-diy_v4_assembled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Assembled DIY Air quality monitor by AirGradient&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the new sensor on my nightstand. The next morning, the results were bad. While fresh air sits at 400 ppm and stuffiness symptoms begin around 1,000 ppm, my room was peaking at &lt;strong&gt;1,700 ppm&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;
While it isn’t &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt;, it still might’ve been the reason for my morning grogginess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Overnight CO2&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-SpOXU&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SpOXU/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;396&quot; data-external=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var t in a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;r.style.height=d}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-main-idea&quot;&gt;The Main Idea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rental agreement meant I couldn’t drill holes in walls. The only way for air to get in or out was the 18mm gap under my door. This led to my main idea: &lt;strong&gt;if I could actively push stale air &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; from under the door, the negative pressure in the room would pull fresh air &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; through the trickle vent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heart of this system would be a fan. It needed to be powerful enough but also quiet. My mind went straight to Noctua, a brand PC builders use for silent fans. I chose the NF-F12 PWM model, which has high static pressure (good for pushing air through tight spaces) and low noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the main design challenge: how to funnel the air from a round 120mm fan into a long, thin gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pizza-box-prototype&quot;&gt;The Pizza Box Prototype&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started designing a duct in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery&quot;&gt;CadQuery&lt;/a&gt;, a Python library for making 3D models. I hoped current LLMs could create the 3D model from my description alone, but I was quickly proven wrong. So I did it the old-fashioned way, defining it myself part by part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-v1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A CAD drawing of the first, complicated 3D model showing a fan housing, a 90-degree turn, and a rectangular outlet.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Blue was the part to be used to tie the rope to. French flag is accidental&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first design, I planned to mount the fan and duct directly onto the door with ropes so it would move with it (blue part would push against the door and the notch at the end is for rope). Before starting a long 3D print, I decided to build a quick and dirty prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using two pizza boxes and some tape, I mocked up the shape. I held my cardboard contraption against the door with the rope, just as I’d planned. Then, I let the rope go slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just sat there. On the floor. Perfectly stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a facepalm moment. I had to laugh at myself for over-engineering it. Why did I think it needed a complex mounting system? It could just be a simple, floor-standing unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-pizza_prototype_suspended.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photo of the prototype made from pizza boxes and tape, suspended near the floor by the door.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prototype also &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt;, lowering the CO2 by about 150 ppm with the fan at 40% speed (for lower noise). Now it was time to improve on the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-3d-print&quot;&gt;First 3D Print&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first 3D-printed version came from a research rabbit hole. I’d read that industrial ventilation needs huge, smooth turns to prevent turbulence. The result was a beast—a three-part device with 4mm thick walls that looked like a defensive tower from a strategy game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-v2_printed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photo of the large, three-part 3D printed &amp;quot;tower&amp;quot; duct, alonside the pizza box prototype.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked a little better than the prototype, lowering CO2 by about 200 ppm by itself. But looking at it I realized it was overkill. For my setup, I didn’t need industrial-grade design, the air speed was almost imperceptibly low. I could make the duct much simpler and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;further-improvements&quot;&gt;Further Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to just add more fans side-by-side, but that would get expensive and might be premature. I decided to improve the design first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first breakthrough came one morning, as I was lying in bed; my brain must have been working on the problem in the background. &lt;em&gt;Why the 90-degree turn?&lt;/em&gt; The fan could work in any orientation. By placing the fan on its side, I could get rid of the turn completely. This would save a massive amount of plastic and print time, and also reduce air friction losses from the bend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to CadQuery and designed a much sleeker version. The defensive tower had evolved into a… simple funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-v4-cad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A CAD drawing of the new, simpler funnel-shaped duct.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After printing two new funnels, experimentation led to two more improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of just pushing stale air &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt;, using one fan to actively pull fresh air &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; from the hallway dropped the CO2 by another 100 ppm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was no draft in the room. Air exchange away from the door was slow, likely relying on simple diffusion. I realized I could accelerate this. I already had quiet standing fan so I placed it near the door, aimed inwards. That, surprisingly, cut another 200 ppm without adding more fans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-final-current-system&quot;&gt;The &lt;del&gt;Final&lt;/del&gt; Current System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the area by my door is a mess of wires and fans, but it works. A single power adapter feeds a PWM controller, which then splits the signal to my three fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Peak CO2 based on setup&quot; aria-label=&quot;Bar Chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-DNhwZ&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DNhwZ/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;233&quot; data-external=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var t in a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;r.style.height=d}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-v4-v3-prototype.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My current setup, from left to right: the new funnel duct (v4), the &amp;quot;defensive tower&amp;quot; (v2), and the original pizza box prototype. The second funnel and the standing fan are not shown.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPD&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44366535&quot;&gt;Hacker News discussion&lt;/a&gt; gave me a great new idea: flip the entire system on its head. Instead of creating negative pressure at the door, I could create &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; pressure from the source of fresh air. This means installing a fan directly in the trickle vent to actively pump fresh air &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;. I’ll need to design a new duct to adapt the fan to the vent’s shape and add a coarse filter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still don’t fully understand why the system works as it does. Is it really creating negative pressure and pulling fresh air through the trickle vent, like I first thought? Or is it just mixing the air near the door and propagating it? The next step is to find a way to measure the actual airflow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other improvement is more practical. Right now, my setup is a functional but messy collection of parts. I’d like to design and print a single, clean enclosure to hold all the fans. It would look better and be much easier to move out of the way when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-am-i-mickey-mouse-now&quot;&gt;So, Am I Mickey Mouse Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t wake up with a cartoonish smile every day. But my mornings &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; better. The grogginess is mostly gone, and I feel more rested. Of course, it could be the summer starting (circadian rhythm/melatonin change, etc), placebo or some combinations of factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, I loved the process. I learned about ventilation, got better at 3D modeling &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; 3D printing, and felt the satisfaction of building something real that solved my own problem. That journey, with all its mistakes and small victories, was the real reward.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/06/02/Biohacking-and-me&quot;&gt;my biohacking days&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been pretty strict about sleep hygiene. I consistently get my 8 hours, go to bed at the same time, and avoid things like late-night meals or alcohol. I was confident the issue wasn’t just poor sleep habits. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt_separator--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment, it hit me just how much I’d already outsourced—maybe even too much. She noticed (quicker than I did!) that I’d become increasingly dependent on AI, whose capabilities seem to grow by the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started innocently enough. Small questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What meal can I make with these leftovers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;quickly escalated to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Should we move to another city?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long, decisions I’d usually ponder through journaling, or with trusted friends, had slowly become quick prompts to ChatGPT, answered instantly. Convenience quietly replaced reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begs the question: when do we cross the line from helpful to dangerously passive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;better-decisions&quot;&gt;Better decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I chatted about this with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Aay17ush&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt;. We talked about how little practice we really get with life’s biggest choices: leaving a job, ending a relationship, deciding to move abroad. These choices come up infrequently yet have massive stakes attached, no wonder we struggle with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, AI seems almost irresistible. Trained on humanity’s collective experiences, less affected by the emotional blind spots that hinder our judgment,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; wouldn’t AI naturally tend to make wiser, more objective choices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cheat-code-to-life&quot;&gt;Cheat code to life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet&lt;/em&gt;, even if AI produces objectively better outcomes, could depending on it take away something vital?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of using cheat codes in video games as a child (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IDDQD&lt;/code&gt;, anyone?). At first, cheating felt amazing. Soon afterward, however, I noticed something unexpected—I wasn’t having any fun. The challenge vanished, the tension collapsed, and with them disappeared all the joy and meaning behind playing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder: Could over-depending on AI feel the same way, robbing me of life’s struggles—the very struggles that I suspect build character, resilience, and empathy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve resorted to cheats in games when they became frustratingly hard or when low mood got the best of me, &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; when I knew it would spoil the fun longer-term. If I can’t resist that temptation in gaming, how can I resist the allure of AI making my life easier?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But maybe&lt;/em&gt; the gaming analogy doesn’t perfectly map onto real life. It’s worth exploring the limitations of this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-life-isnt-a-carefully-crafted-video-game&quot;&gt;Real life isn’t a carefully crafted video game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our daily challenges aren’t necessarily meaningful or valuable. Many struggles aren’t instructive—they’re random, painful occurrences delivering little personal growth or satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these circumstances, reducing unnecessary trauma and harm isn’t “cheating”; it’s just common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-all-gain-requires-pain&quot;&gt;Not all gain requires pain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe I’ve overestimated the necessity of struggle and hardship for personal growth. Positive experiences like curiosity and creativity, can also shape who we become. Perhaps AI might help us learn and grow without unnecessarily painful detours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-some-gain-still-might&quot;&gt;…but some gain still might?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s a risk: if we delegate &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; challenging decision, we might lose the valuable tension that drives personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s value in wrestling with uncertainty even when the AI reliably suggests &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; good path. That tension carries meaning—or at the very least feels very human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;local-maxima-trap&quot;&gt;Local maxima trap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further complicating things&lt;/em&gt;, even if AI could perfectly optimize for our preferences, it might trap us in a ‘local maximum’—offering instant relief while stalling long-term growth. Picture an AI that keeps you in barely tolerable relationships or jobs, preventing the discomfort that often sparks transformative change.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In short, short-term comfort might lead to long-term stagnation, much like the marshmallow test suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;convenience-vs-agency&quot;&gt;Convenience vs. Agency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these thoughts bring me back to larger questions of personal agency. As AI improves, will relying on it drain my sense of autonomy? Will life lose some deep, intangible spark if I delegate too many important decisions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current view: we will have to try and see. What comforts me a bit is reflecting on my life thus far. Despite thinking of myself as the &lt;em&gt;instant gratification monkey&lt;/em&gt;, my life tells a different story—I actually go out of my comfort zone and do stuff despite the lure of The Algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I expect AI to become more powerful, more useful, and I also feel confident that I’ll notice if I start veering toward an unfulfilling, agency-lacking existence—and trust myself to course-correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your thoughts, and I’m curious how future-me will reflect on another year of closer reliance on AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To be clear, today’s AIs carry &lt;em&gt;all the biases&lt;/em&gt; inherited from training data; the hope is that they balance each other out. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Current AIs are good at surface-level optimization but may fail to suggest difficult-in-the-moment but ultimately enriching decisions. Future models could potentially integrate secondary- and tertiary-level consequences, vectorize your preferences and &lt;em&gt;your whole psyche&lt;/em&gt;, and ultimately be able to make decisions that are &lt;em&gt;just good for you&lt;/em&gt;.

When I look at earlier posts, I see something like a trophy board to show everyone how smart and likable I am.&lt;!--excerpt_separator--&gt;
Although everything I wrote about back then was and is really interesting to me, it still seems dishonest somehow. I guess my current mood is different from the one I used to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want to try something different. I’m going to write about the books I absolutely love. Not about philosophy or the role of technology in today’s world. Just 3 books that have made the last seven years much more pleasant for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of writing is harder to do because it makes me more vulnerable, it’s not only about the books but about me and my history with them. It’s something dear to my heart: what if you don’t like it? What if you criticize me and my haphazard way of gushing about these books?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, for the joy of writing this, I’m still willing to take the risk :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading fantasy and science fiction for more than 25 years. I started with Wells, Stanislaw Lem, the Strugatsky brothers, Ray Bradbury, and Philip K. Dick.
After reading through the classics, I discovered the Hugo and Nebula Awards for SF and went through all the finalists. After that, I gradually moved on to lesser and lesser known books and authors.
After scraping the bottom of the barrel for some time, I lucked into web series, books written one chapter at a time and posted on forums or blogs. And how glad I am that I found them, because all the books on this list below are representatives of this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality&quot;&gt;Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Eliezer Yudkowsky [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hpmor.com/&quot;&gt;link to the (free) book&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2022-07-09-My-favorite-fiction-books-hpmor-book-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover showing a hand with fingers poised to snap&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, this is the one book I won’t stop raving about. The following text is just my fanboy noises aimed to get you to read this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sure that fanfics are nothing more than erotic fantasies of teenagers turned into text. In &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; forums and with lots of grammatical errors. Or they are not very funny parody books that want to exploit the fame of the original to cash in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tacky title of this fanfic didn’t help it stand out from that crowd. It was the author’s name that helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliezer was known to me as the champion of the rationality movement and author of many articles on lesswrong.com.
Just the fact that such a person wrote a fanfic began to change my image of what a fanfic is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also helped that the author suggests in the preface to stop reading the book after the fifth chapter if you weren’t hooked. That’s a good heuristic to use with other books as well — it allows you to start a long book without fear of committing to finish it. And this is a book of considerable length.
Fortunately this is one of those cases where the length of a book seems intimidating at first, but then becomes a joy when you realize that many more pages of this fascinating entertainment await you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enjoy this book, &lt;strong&gt;you don’t have to like or even have read the original&lt;/strong&gt; Harry Potter books.
It’s my top 1 recommendation even for people who don’t read much fiction at all (and they love it too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once tried to write my own novel. I researched how to structure it, how to edit it. I used my project management skills to break it down into small chunks and wrote them out. I edited them in iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sucked and the result was crap. I didn’t have the motivation to practice and get better.
But since then, when I re-read HPMOR, I notice all the things the author did that are just. so. good. How it hooks me in emotionally and intellectually. How it changes the cadence without ever being too slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sad at the end of the first read, knowing for a fact that such excitingly captivating books are very few and hard to find.
But there’s hope! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits&quot;&gt;Significant Digits&lt;/a&gt; by Alexander Davis is “the best HPMOR continuation fic” (quote from Elizer). The other books in this post are also similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elizer is mainly working on AI alignment. I don’t want our world to end as much as the next guy, but it’s a pity Eliezer isn’t writing SF books for a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;worm&quot;&gt;Worm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By John C. McCrae [&lt;a href=&quot;https://parahumans.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;link to the (free) book&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2022-07-09-My-favorite-fiction-books-worm-book-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover showing a metropolitan city skyline with an overcast sky&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grimdark world where superheroes aren’t so good and villains aren’t so evil is a popular theme these days, just think of the recent popularity of The Boys TV series. But Worm was the first book of this genre for me, and boy, did it take me away for &lt;em&gt;a ride&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endless cliffhangers and conflict escalation led to many nights where I couldn’t stop reading until sleep finally took me at 4am. Usually when a book is this interesting I finish it quickly, but not this one. This book is 4 Wars and Peaces long. So it was &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I finally finished it, I wanted more. And the fanfic world didn’t disappoint. I’ve been reading Worm fanfics for years. I’m not exaggerating, here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/Worm&quot;&gt;an (incomplete) list of them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over dozens of fanfics, the characters and setting have become familiar to me, all the key situations have been lived through from different angles with different consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I liked Worm because it fit my depressed mood at the time, but after years of fanfics, this world has become the ultimate cozy feel-good read, where I return to old friends and places and relieve fond memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This transition to warm and fuzzy was influenced by some of ack1308’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5180580/ack1308&quot;&gt;wholesome Worm fanfics&lt;/a&gt;, where each and every conflict is resolved in the best possible way.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;worth-the-candle&quot;&gt;Worth The Candle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alexander Wales [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle&quot;&gt;link to the (free) book&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2022-07-09-My-favorite-fiction-books-worth-the-candle-book-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover showing a man fighting with a much bigger humanoid opponent&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LitRPG to rule them all. Interesting mechanics, but not too much of it. So meta and trope-riding, -bending, -exploiting that it’s at least three levels deep.
The author is the king of nuanced worldbuilding. My god! He’s made a variety of worlds with details down history and politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other fiction&lt;/strong&gt;: a horde of ugly goblins invade with mindless fury, killing innocents and destroying millennia-old elven forests. They force the main character to wipe them out. He moves on to the next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book&lt;/strong&gt;: a horde of ugly goblins invades. But their ugliness doesn’t dehumanize them, they’re still people. People who have a long history with elves, with war crimes on both sides. The new political regime of Goblinland forced this goblin contingent to flee their lands or be persecuted as a minority. There are also women and children behind the soldiers. The main character understands all this and when the negotiations fail, it’s not an easy moral decision to kill the goblins. Some of the horde warriors are defeated, but that still leaves the surrendering goblins and their families to deal with. You’ll need logistics to organize it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarian crisis, supply chains, politics, ethics — this book has it all, and that rare depth pleasantly tickles my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author seems so much smarter than I’m that he can conjure up all these worlds and unite them in a story with just the right… everything for me. It’s like reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/&quot;&gt;Slate Star Codex&lt;/a&gt;: someone intelligent has thought through a lot of details and made them accessible to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, and this is a recurring feature of all the books on this list, this book is lusciously long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honorable mention&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A progression fantasy in which the protagonist grows not only in skills, but also in wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first chapter felt a bit awkward in terms of dialogue, but then the story really picked up, the complex situation unravelling with lots of action, and that hooked me in till the satisfying end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="book" /><summary type="html">I wanted to write something without too much virtue signaling.

An endeavour for 2-3 hours that has visible results. A satisfying project, I invite everyone with a light-theme-only blog to try.
&lt;!--excerpt_separator--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2022-02-06-Dark-mode-implementation-for-this-blog--dark-mode-example-picture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An article screenshot, one half of which is in light mode and the other half is in dark mode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CSS Tricks&lt;/em&gt;, of course, has this topic thoroughly covered in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;Complete Guide to Dark Mode on the Web&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll describe what I’ve done in this particular blog and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { ... }&lt;/code&gt; CSS media query which lets me use OS-level user preferences. I chose not to support manual toggling between modes because of two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation involves JavaScript swapping CSS classes and storing state in Local Storage–a harder effort than I wanted for this quick-win project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a user has strong preferences about the dark mode, I imagine such a user already has a way of controlling the interface. Such as a browser plugin that changes the theme, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://darkreader.org/&quot;&gt;Dark Reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As dark mode gains momentum, I think major browsers will display a toggle between modes (not only in Dev Tools) making the effort of creating this toggle myself moot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog uses a modified &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johno/pixyll&quot;&gt;Pixyll theme&lt;/a&gt; that has &lt;strong&gt;32&lt;/strong&gt; SASS files that get compiled into one big CSS file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2022-02-06-Dark-mode-implementation-for-this-blog--sass-includes-listing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Part of includes listing @importing separate SASS files for links, code, header, etc&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This otherwise reasonable divide-and-conquer approach bites me in the ass here, as I needed to insert the media-query block 17 times. For each style, I wanted to look different when dark. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrey-lepekhin/andrey-lepekhin.github.io/commit/b54227499b737f5042d151f60c39416e88c9ba4b&quot;&gt;the actual commit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could instead place all dark mode styles in one such file, but then I’ll lose the handy separation these files provide. Also, in the future, if I change a light mode style, the proximity of the corresponding dark mode style will remind me to change it as well. Something I might otherwise forget to do and test for.
If there is a better way, please tell me about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that’s basically it: adding media-query styles and selecting particular colors that look good on dark background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love awkward questions, they make one vulnerable and create a possibility for closeness and/or satisfaction of one’s needs. Here is a paper that helps stop avoiding sensitive questions.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3437468&quot;&gt;I Didn’t Want to Offend You: The Cost of Avoiding Sensitive Questions&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Einav Hart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Eric VanEpps&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Maurice E. Schweitzer&lt;/em&gt;
A quote from the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Across three pilot studies and four experimental studies, we demonstrate that individuals avoid asking sensitive questions, because they fear making others uncomfortable and because of impression management concerns. We demonstrate that this aversion to asking sensitive questions is both costly and misguided.&lt;/p&gt;

Also this way of seeing developer work as preparation for inevitable change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Change is the name of the game we’re in. What we do as programmers is manage change. When we do that well we call it design, or architecture. When we do it badly we call it technical debt, or legacy code.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you are writing a program that works perfectly, one time, for one fixed set of inputs then nobody cares if the code is good or bad because ultimately the output of the program is all the business cares about.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But this is never true. Software has bugs, requirements change, inputs change, and very few programs are written solely to be executed once, thus your program will change over time. Maybe it’s you who’ll be tasked with this, more likely it will be someone else, but someone has to change that code. Someone has to maintain that code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think that I see a hidden meaning, a secret game being played behind the curtains of everyday interactions. Naturally, I like articles about signalling and social games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A player of the Importance Game tries to ascend high enough to reach for something that will set her above her interlocutor, a player of the Leveling Game reaches down low enough to hit common ground. The former needs to signal enough power to establish a hierarchy; the latter enough powerlessness to establish equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In an academic context, I’ve noticed that complaining about how busy one is hits a sweet spot of oppression—I cannot manage my life!—and importance—because I am so in demand! When you’re playing with a master, it can be hard to tell which game you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ending of the article is too unclear for my taste, but then I’m no philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><summary type="html">Who Wants to Play the Status Game? by Agnes Callard</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pitfalls of our simplistic moral evaluation system</title><link href="https://www.lepekhin.com/2020/02/23/Pitfalls-of-our-simplistic-moral-evaluation-system" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pitfalls of our simplistic moral evaluation system" /><published>2020-02-23T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-02-23T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://www.lepekhin.com/2020/02/23/Pitfalls-of-our-simplistic-moral-evaluation-system</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lepekhin.com/2020/02/23/Pitfalls-of-our-simplistic-moral-evaluation-system">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/M2LWXsJxKS626QNEA/the-trouble-with-good&quot;&gt;The Trouble With “Good”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Scott Alexander&lt;/em&gt; describes some problems that stem from our evolutionary-induced simplistic good-bad evaluation system (emotivism), that meshes moral beliefs with facts and personal preferences.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll only paste one quote as the post itself has just the right composition to be clear enough while not being too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So this is one problem: the inputs to our mental karma system aren’t always closely related to the real merit of a person/thing/idea.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another problem: our interpretation of whether to upvote or downvote something depends on how many upvotes or downvotes it already has. […]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another problem: we are tempted to assign everything about a concept the same score. Eliezer Yudkowsky currently has 2486 karma. How good is Eliezer at philosophy? Apparently somewhere around the level it would take to get 2486 karma. How much does he know about economics? Somewhere around level 2486 would be my guess. How well does he write? Probably well enough to get 2486 karma. Translated into mental terms, this looks like the Halo Effect. Yes, we can pick apart our analyses in greater detail; having read Eliezer’s posts, I know he’s better at some things than others. But that 2486 number is going to cause anchoring-and-adjustment issues even so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But the big problem, the world-breaking problem, is that sticking everything good and bad about something into one big bin and making decisions based on whether it’s a net positive or a net negative is an unsubtle, leaky heuristic completely unsuitable for complicated problems.&lt;/p&gt;

This post is for people who live in a metropolitan area, have enough income to rent a place for themselves (with flatmates if needed), don’t have commitments that prohibit them from moving and, most importantly, are &lt;strong&gt;not satisfied with their commute time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to describe why I came to a decision to rent a pricey apartment downtown. This is part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/tag/renting/&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; where I share my tools and thinking processes towards renting: from changing your mindset to apartment research to communication with your landlord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rationale&quot;&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every extra minute of commute time reduces job satisfaction, reduces leisure time satisfaction, increases strain and reduces mental health.&lt;br /&gt;
[…]&lt;br /&gt;
An additional 10 minutes (each way) of commuting time is associated with the equivalent effect on job satisfaction as a 19% reduction in gross personal income.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travelbehaviour.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/caw-summaryreport-onlineedition.pdf&quot;&gt;Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think of my 1h 10m (each way) commute as a needed tribute to adult values, something most of my college friends did (sometimes with much longer travel times), something inescapable. But studies similar to the one cited above and my own happiness being affected due to the mediocre use of these precious hours brought me to a realization: I want to live closer to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-thrifty-can-be-an-issue&quot;&gt;Being thrifty can be an issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one problem though — it was prohibitively expensive. Technically, I could afford it, but habituated with cheap living while spending less than half of my income, I just could not justify such an expense. The thought of the yearly cost of rent in the city filled my frugal self with outrage. &lt;em&gt;That’s an unfair price!&lt;/em&gt; — I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could I be wrong? What if those hours spent commuting really are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; valuable than even such a sizeable chunk of money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/05/reclaim-your-commute&quot;&gt;2017 article published in &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers discussed the results of a study they conducted where they asked subjects to choose between two jobs:&lt;br /&gt;
●	Job #1 had a 50-minute round-trip commute and paid $67,000 a year.&lt;br /&gt;
●	Job #2 had a 20-minute round-trip commute and paid $64,000 a year.&lt;br /&gt;
84% of the participants in the study selected job #1, as researchers wrote, “expressing a willingness to forfeit one hour each workday to their commute—250 hours per year—in exchange for just $3,000. That’s $12 an hour of commuting time—less than half their hourly rate at work!”&lt;br /&gt;
They concluded that people were unable to “fully appreciate the psychological, emotional, and physical costs of longer travel times.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how to overcome this bias and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measure-an-adequate-cost-of-time-spent-commuting&quot;&gt;Measure an adequate cost of time spent commuting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first approach was to answer a hypothetical like: “&lt;em&gt;After 9 hours at work, Mr. Burns wants me to do some menial work for another hour. How much does he have to pay for me to be satisfied with this hour?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;br /&gt;
That provided an amount of 12 000 ₽&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as a result. I had to revise the question immediately as the real situation was not so one-sided:&lt;br /&gt;
I enjoy reading on the tube, and I don’t mind a brisk walk of up to 20 minutes. So, the question had to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out I was already asking myself a useful question before every Uber drive: “Am I willing to pay this amount for speed and comfort instead of using public transport?” &lt;br /&gt;
With that, I realized a better question to ask before commuting is: “&lt;strong&gt;How much am I willing to pay right now to be home/at work in 20 minutes?&lt;/strong&gt;” I answered this question every day for two weeks and got a variety of results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2019-11-26-table-how-much-to-fly-to-work.png&quot; alt=&quot;The table with varying answers for each morning and evening of 10 weekdays, with median calculated as 1350 rub.&quot; /&gt;
Some days I dreaded the tube, and some days it was more… acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median price I was willing to pay per 50 commute-free minutes was nine times lower than the sum that my initial question provided. That’s 1350*60/50 = 1620 ₽ per hour of commute time saved. That applies to work days only, so to compare apples with apples, I’ll smear that number throughout an average month = 1620*22/30 = 1188 ₽. Let’s see what it will get me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2019-11-26-Moscow_rent_cost_map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Heat map of rent prices of Moscow. Higher prices in city center&quot; /&gt;
The price of renting is higher the closer you are to downtown, which is filled with offices and historic places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a table to calculate the daily cost of time saved on commuting and the daily cost of rent in the corresponding neighborhoods&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2019-11-26-table-daily-rent-vs-cost-of-saved-time.png&quot; alt=&quot;The table which shows said calculations. Daily cost of saved free time minus cost of rent in the area of 20 minutes commute is positive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positive numbers in the last column mean that the price I’m willing to pay for a lesser commute is higher than the rent cost in the area that will provide said commute. What do you know, my frugal self &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; afford to live closer to the office! :tada:&lt;br /&gt;
…And that’s not even counting the opportunity costs of a long commute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, making a decision is easy, I’m going to rent downtown!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The next post is about how to approach selecting a neighborhood within an acceptable distance from your office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That’s around $200. Hereafter, prices will be in Rubles since I’m in Moscow, but it shouldn’t matter. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are two important assumptions made for simplification here: 1) These two weeks are not outliers 2) Each minute of commute costs exactly the same. That’s somehow irrelevant as the equilibrium between daily rent and the cost of saved time was achieved exactly at the 20-minute mark - the time I asked about in the previous question. Happy coincidence. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Something that has also helped my paradigm shift and start this whole process was an honest acceptance of the fact that yes, rent is expensive, it may not seem fair, but it’s a seller’s market and my outrage will not change this one bit. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
