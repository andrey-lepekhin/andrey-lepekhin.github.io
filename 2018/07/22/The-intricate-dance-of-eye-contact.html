What are they signaling? Did the interlocutor notice your move?</p> <p><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/look-em-in-the-eye-part-ii-how-to-make-eye-contact-the-right-way-in-life-business-and-love/">How to Make Eye Contact the Right Way in Life, Business, and Love</a> by Brett &amp; Kate McKay.</p> <p>For some time, I’ve been mindful about my own eye contact during various forms of communication. But I never did the next step — treat and interpret the variety of possible eye contacts as the signals they are. We’re hardwired to interpret eye contact as a signal to answer questions like are you interested or not, are you submissive or dominant, are you trustworthy?</p> <p>For example, in some contexts, I just took notice that “it’s uncomfortable to hold that gaze” and concluded “I’ll look at the table instead”. After reading this article, I started making the next step of assessing the situation: “…which could be interpreted as me signaling lower status”. After that I can choose whether that is something I want to happen right now.</p> <p>Having predetermined etiquette for expressing interest in the opposite sex is also very handy. In the past, after meeting a woman’s gaze several times I usually started thinking “Does it mean anything, or is it a coincidence? Should I go say hi now or wait a couple of minutes to be sure?”. The article conveniently answers these questions and more.</p> <blockquote> <p>When you look over at a woman, she will usually look away, whether she’s interested in you or not. But the way in which she averts her gaze tells you a lot about whether she wants you to approach her or not […]</p> </blockquote> <p>I will not paste more quotes, the article is small and neatly divided with subheadings so you can take only what you need:</p> <ul> <li>General guidelines on how to do it. When to look, where to look, how long, how to avert your gaze and what does it signal</li> <li>Sales and pitching (job interviews included)</li> <li>When you need to intimidate/dominate or diffuse a conflict</li> <li>Meeting the eyes of a stranger in the street</li> <li>Making eye contact with a woman</li> <li>When giving a speech</li> </ul> <p>After I started paying attention and <em>choosing</em> my eye contact behavior rather than <em>reacting</em>, I’ve became more confident in almost all of those situations. And confidence feels great.</p> <p>What else might I be missing? I’m sure there are more nuances to communication than I know of, after all <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/07/concept-shaped-holes-can-be-impossible-to-notice/">Concept-Shaped Holes Can Be Impossible To Notice</a>. <a href="https://www.lepekhin.com/about#contact-me">Drop me a line</a> if you have something in mind.</p> </article> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="center"> <div class="measure"> <small> <!--Did <i>you</i> meditate <i>today</i>?--> <a href="https://www.lepekhin.com/feed.xml">RSS</a> </small> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
