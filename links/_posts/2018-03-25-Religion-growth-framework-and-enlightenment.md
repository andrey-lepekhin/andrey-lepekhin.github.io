_Tim Urban_ about [Religion for the Nonreligious](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html)  
Like many of his great posts, this one is long. I've read it in 2015 when I was struggling to find my way around religion and it stroke a chord. _For me_, it's about two things:

#### 1. States of mind
(1) Engulfed in primitive, primal thoughts  
(2) See things as they are, enlightenment  

#### 2. Creating a better belief system
...smelted with a _growth framework_.  
Coincidentally, growth framework is something that I lacked in 2015. I now have a system in place, it's still new and I'm not as religious about it as Tim. I will make a post about it after 1 year test-drive.



Short quote

> Yes, I’m an atheist, but atheism isn’t a growth model any more than “I don’t like rollerblading” is a workout strategy.
