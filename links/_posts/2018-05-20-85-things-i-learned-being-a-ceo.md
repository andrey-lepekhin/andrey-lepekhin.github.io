A Hackernoon [post](https://hackernoon.com/85-things-i-learned-being-a-ceo-4c25fc1c7b99) where _Sachin Gupta_ details lessons from his CEO career in the areas of job's key responsibilities, decision making, culture, leadership, self-management, people management, meetings, hiring, and fundraising.  

Currently, the most relevant for me are these parts about meetings

> Explicitly ask people if you are needed to be part of a meeting. Wherever you are needed, ask them for an agenda and also ask what is expected from you in the meeting. Else say no. 

> There are only 2 types of meetings that you should attend — a) where you have to take a decision b) where you get updates/information. The productivity of the first depends solely on you and the latter on how you have trained your team. Step out from any meeting where you are not going to take any decision and you are not getting information you already don’t have.
