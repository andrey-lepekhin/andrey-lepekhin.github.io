_Eliezer Yudkowsky_'s  [Use the Try Harder, Luke](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fhEPnveFhb9tmd7Pe/use-the-try-harder-luke)
â€” is a short funny story about how we're conditioned for giving up fast, after (also hastily) labeling something as impossible.  



This continues with a longer piece [On Doing the Impossible](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fpecAJLG9czABgCe9/on-doing-the-impossible)

> To do things that are very difficult or "impossible",  
> First you have to not run away.  That takes seconds.  
> Then you have to work.  That takes hours.  
> Then you have to stick at it.  That takes years.
