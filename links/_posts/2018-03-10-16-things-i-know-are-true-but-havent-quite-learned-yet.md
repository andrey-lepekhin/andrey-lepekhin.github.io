_David Cain_ [about things that he knows are good for him but he still only does them seldomly](http://www.raptitude.com/2013/12/16-things-i-know-are-true-but-havent-quite-learned-yet/).  

Number 8 will _blow your mind_! Just kidding. But seriously, I'll quote the ones that apply to me the most:

> 2) I never regret working out. [...]

> 10) The quickest and most reliable path to personal improvement is to do the things on my list that I resist most. [...]

> 11) All you need to do to finish things is keep starting them until they’re done. [...]

> 14) The most consistently joyful activities for me are visiting with other people and reading books. 

After spending most of my life preferring various solitary entertainments to _socializing_, I've recently came to similar understanding about meeting other people. It seems to energize me and fill me with joy (self-reported mood data supports it). The trick is to find like-minded people. Maybe I'll write a post about it sometime - it was a very big change in my life.
