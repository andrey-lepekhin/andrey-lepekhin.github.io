_Heather Havrilesky_ with her raw, passionate and poignant article about (re)defining your self. [Why Am I So Lazy?](https://www.thecut.com/2018/01/ask-polly-why-am-i-so-lazy.html)  


> You know how they say “Scratch a cynic, find a romantic”? Well, scratch an underachiever and find a hard worker afraid of disappointing herself. Both the cynic and the underachiever are afraid of sticking their necks out and becoming who they deeply, passionately want to become, for fear of looking stupid or failing. [...] I’ll bet you’re not even an introvert at heart. You’re someone who wants to live out loud, share herself with the world, and stop overthinking and delaying and avoiding the pesky little tasks that make up a life. 

Sometimes I wonder if I'm that romantic in hiding. While, indeed, I can be _skeptical_ about all this passion-speech, in the end Heather recommends much of the same approach that I currently support: experimentation.


> Get a therapist. Experiment with schedules. Try on different behaviors for size. Get very organized (without piles of things on the floor). Try making new friends. Try vigorous exercise. Try leaving the house more. Try not leaving. Try writing your feelings down. Check in with your body when you do things that stress you out. Notice your feelings. Express your feelings. Be honest, be honest, be honest. Take notes.
