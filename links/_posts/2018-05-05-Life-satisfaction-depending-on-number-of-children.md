My current position is _against_ having children due to huge time commitment necessary to raise them. I do not factor in children's happiness or their possible utility to the world into my decision. But then again, I am not an effective altruist (yet?) and do not have a pronounced moral stance as Scott does.


Here's a (post)[http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/16/bundles-of-joy/] by _Scott Alexander_ where he analyses his survey results in the context of life satisfaction of people having children. After reading this, I'm a tad more inclined to think about it.
