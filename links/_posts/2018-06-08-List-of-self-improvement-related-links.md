As with [entrepreneurship-related articles list]({% post_url links/2018-03-05-List-of-entrepreneur-related-links %}), I just want to offload this bunch of articles sitting in my Pocket.  
When (if) I come reading through them, I will add descriptions and short versions.  
**Beware** this is a work in progress, some articles may be more than just a little dubious. Though you can still use this list to judge what were my 28-year-old self's problems.
