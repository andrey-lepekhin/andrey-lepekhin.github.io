I love awkward questions, they make one vulnerable and create a possibility for closeness and/or satisfaction of one's needs. Here is a paper that helps stop avoiding sensitive questions.
[I Didn’t Want to Offend You: The Cost of Avoiding Sensitive Questions](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3437468) by _Einav Hart_, _Eric VanEpps_, and _Maurice E. Schweitzer_
A quote from the abstract:
> Across three pilot studies and four experimental studies, we demonstrate that individuals avoid asking sensitive questions, because they fear making others uncomfortable and because of impression management concerns. We demonstrate that this aversion to asking sensitive questions is both costly and misguided.
