I plan to start my [Comfort Zone Crusher course](http://www.comfortzonecrusher.com/) some time this year.  
Here's a few good citations about beliefs that hamper your social life:




> You don’t need to make people like you. Learn to be okay with who you are, and you’re going to attract people who naturally like you.

> The easier you are on yourself, the more likely you will say something that resonates with the people around you.

> Your social skills are good enough. Instead, work on overcoming your fear.

> Fear is NOT the problem. Our reaction to fear is.
> Instead of learning to get rid of fear, we need to learn to take action DESPITE feeling fear. This means saying “Hi” to a stranger, even though you have shaky knees, trembling hands, and a squeaky voice.
> Take action despite feeling fear. This is what courage is all about.
