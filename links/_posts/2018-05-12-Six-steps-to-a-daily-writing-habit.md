How to use Beeminder for a daily habit of X.  
[A great post](http://socratic-form-microscopy.com/2017/06/18/six-steps-to-a-daily-writing-habit/) by _Zachary Jacobi_

> I recommend looking at Beeminder not as a tool to effectively guilt yourself into writing, but as a reminder of what writing is worth to you. You value consistently writing at $X. You know that every time you skip writing for a day or a week, there is a Y% chance that you might lose the habit. Multiply those two together and you get your ideal maximum Beeminder pledge.

Right now [I use Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/bizzz/pocket) to read up all of my pocketed articles.  
Sometime in the past couple of years I've created a bad akrasia-like habit of pocketing articles that are too hard to read at that moment. "Imma read this funny small LJ post now and let future-Andrey handle that huge SSC post later". I also used to add some neat posts that are useless to me (e.g. HN post about how to use ardruino and tensorflow to detect misoginy in Sillicon Valley). Thus I amassed hundreds of articles and tons of guilt.  
Now, each time I add an article, a point is substracted; a point is added each time I finish one (automation through [IFTTT snippets](https://ifttt.com/pocket)). In the last three months, I've ploughed through 150 articles, some 400 yet to go.
