I describe my processes for writing here and the goals behind those processes.  
Previously: [Hello, world!]({% post_url 2018-02-24-Hello-world %})

## Type: Link-posts 
[Links to articles, posts]({{ site.url }}/category/links/), [webcomics]({{ site.url }}/category/comics/), [videos]({{ site.url }}/tag/video/), etc
— are not included in the general blog roll in the root of this blog

### Purpose
* Satisfy the sharing need: when I find something thought-provoking I get a craving to share it
* Learn something better by explaining it

### Process
1. Get a link into my Pocket mainly from: Hacker News and other IT-infused sources, friends, colleagues or RSS.
1. Read it. If I find some parts that 1) are interesting new information, and 2) probably will improve my life if applied — I share those parts with myself via email.
1. Once in a blue moon I read through such emails and weed out things that are no longer interesting. Maybe it seemed useful and now does not, or maybe I was trying to be trendy and now I see though my past-self. Time buffer.
1. If I still feel like that info is useful, I then create a [link-post]({{ site.url }}/category/links/) with a small description and key quotes so that future-me (and you, dear reader) can get to the point faster.
1. **TODO** Schedule re-reading of old posts or make an anki-like thing to remember and use practical parts.


## Type: General blog posts
— the default type of posts that you see in the root if this blog. 
General blog posts are almost the same as link-posts above but I feel a lot more strongly about sharing these: their perceived importance is high. Also they tend to contain more text written by yours truly.

### Purpose
Getting more writing experience for
* the skill of getting my point across _quicker_
* affecting more people than usual (that is _if_ I make a goal out of making this blog popular in the future)
* creating a thought-archive which I can analyze, and improve upon my thought processes. I think that the ability to write down thoughts is the first major artificial brain augmentation; it would be a shame not to use it.

### Process
Same as for link-posts, but more time-consuming. Also, sometimes I have original ideas whereas link-posts are usually just my interpretation of someone else's ideas.

I will update this post if I change the process or the goals.
