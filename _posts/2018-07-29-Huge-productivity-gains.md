This is how I got **the biggest increase in productivity** in the last 5 years.

The idea is from this article: [How to start on the most important thing every day](http://blog.complice.co/post/121559734412/how-to-start-on-the-most-important-thing-every-day) by Malcolm Ocean (thanks, man!).

> I want to emphasize that this is the most valuable habit I have, by a large margin (and I’ve got some good ones!). Therefore if you’re reading this, I think that it’s at least worth _trying_ to create a similar system in your own life.

I second Malcolm here, go read the article, I’ll wait.  

It is the new norm now, but you wouldn't _believe_ how big this change was for me at the time. The difference was night and day, I wouldn't stop telling my friends about it! Ok, if you're sold, read on for details.


## My impelentation

**Evening**, 2 hours before the sleep time
* Write down the plan for the next morning, including one most important goal, and optional hints like “start the going out routine by 8:00, leave home by 8:30” 

**Morning**, immediately after waking up[^1]
* At least one pomodoro doing the most important task  

Before breaking for any less productive activities like eating, Reddit or email checking:
* Dance to at least one track[^2], immediately followed by
* Meditate for at least 10 minutes




## What didn’t work

### Planning right before bed
I started to plan the next morning before going to bed, but as I was very sleepy, plans that came out were poor. Now I plan 2 hours before bed time, when I’m more lucid.

### Doing things that _look_ like procrastinating
e.g. one time I was looking for a flat to rent and that was my main task for some weeks. Problem is, browsing listings, looking at a lot of pictures, is similar to my relaxation habit of browsing Reddit. After I finished looking through new listings, I noticed that it is super easy to slip into Reddit. I started scheduling my flat search later in the day.

### Planning my day as the first task
After initial success, I drifted toward “plan my whole day and _then_ start that important task”. Didn’t work so well. While planning a day, I usually encountered a small task: “Aha, easy 3-minute win! GTD prepared me for this! I just have to start this Slack conversation to update this status”. Then inevitably I’m replaying to other messages, it’s 15 minutes later and the productive mood is gone. ~~Ok, it’s Slack rant time!~~ I've moved it to a [separate post]({% post_url 2018-07-30-Slack-rant %}).

[^1]: Some mornings I am groggier than on others, that’s where having a clear todo list from the evening before shines – I don’t need to deliberate about what to do, no decision necessary. In case you forgot - [choices are bad]({% post_url 2018-03-01-Why-choices-are-bad %}).
[^2]: Why? According to two years of correlating my activities and mood, dancing consistently makes me happy. Sometimes it’s 3 minutes, sometimes it will be 20.
