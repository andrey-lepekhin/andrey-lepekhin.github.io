During my day job I frequently have to optimize software development tasks to
leave only the most important, essential functionality and cut away all the bells and whistles.  
This is sometimes abbreviated as MVP — Minimal Viable Product.  

  
This blog is an example of a situation where I slipped into wanting to build a _maximum_ viable product but steadied myself, albeit I little late.  


<blockquote>
  <p>
    OK, I need a new web-site
  </p>
  <footer><cite>Me, some time ago</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

**The worst mistake** was that I started working on a solution right away... without defining a problem. I slipped into _"ooh, shiny"_ techie-tinker mindset and was dead set on exploring new and fascinating frontiers of static site generators. The more I researched the more bells and whistles I gathered in my wish-list. It was like a trance.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Of course I need pagination! But not just any pagination, only the best kind: by categories, by tags, by months. Hm, maybe by music and mood too?  
	To do that I just need to quickly read on about Jekyll collections and another couple of posts about how to do it all in a Github-preferred way.

That's when my weekend ended and, still having nothing to show for it, I felt sad and disappointed. I gave up and decided that _if_ I even were to get new site, I will hire a professional to do it.
Some weeks later I even started making a tech spec to post on a freelance exchange. Including the fancy pagination et al, of course.  

There was a slight problem though. I noticed a strange thing: it was really hard for me to describe in technical language what was required. Interesting. How come? 
Realization struck: I just really didn't see the end product. And when I tried probing questions to elicit requirements from myself I understood that I was the proverbial _perpetually-almost-satisfied_ client with an unlimited number of edits and improvements because he doesn’t know what he wants.


That's when a stray thought of MVP came to me and I understood how wrong I've been.
I don’t need fancy pagination or archived posts. I just need something to start pouring my thoughts into that also doesn't look hideous.
That's when I installed [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and slapped the [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) theme on it and here we are.


### Summary of what I learned

Before diving into a new sexy project
1. Describe the end result in necessary detail 
1. Remember why _do_ you want to do this at all. Is this new project the best way to achieve your end goal?
1. Cut out everything that is not essential
