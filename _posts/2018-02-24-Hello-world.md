I've bit the bullet and decided to create this thing.
I plan to use it for

* post links to articles, images, videos â€” anything that I like, with a small comment or quote about what in particular got my attenton
* post about my [thought, goal-setting, etc] processes with the goal of internal and external audit. As Zvi put it:

> Writing down your conclusions often makes you realize where your conclusions are wrong, or your techniques can be improved. Having to put  all of your justifications into precise words, in a place others could read them, makes most bad reasoning obvious if you are paying attention.
