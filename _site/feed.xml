He told me that, ideally, I should wake up like Mickey Mouse: bright, energetic, and ready to leap out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-pseudo-Mickey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Animated mouse waking up, looking chipper. Generated by ChatGPT.&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Legally distinct, chipper morning mouse.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about my own mornings. The reality was a slow, groggy 30-minute crawl out of sleep. Mickey Mouse? I was more like a grumpy bear waking up from a long hibernation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day, the ventilation failed in my office. After a few hours in the stuffy air, I had the exact same groggy feeling and a splitting headache. The pieces clicked into place. My office felt just like my bedroom in the morning. The enemy was CO2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bedroom was the perfect trap. As a light sleeper in the city, I seal it for silence. The window is closed to block out seagulls, and the door is shut to mute the rest of the apartment. Ventilation-wise my room has only a “trickle vent” – a small slit above the window to suck in fresh air based on pressure difference. But it didn’t feel like it was enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, a new obsession was born. I have a habit of looking for a “silver bullet”, a single fix that I believe will solve &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. If I could just lower the CO2 in my bedroom, I’d be more productive, make better decisions, and be happier. These waves of inspiration are my favorite part of any project. The bullet never solves all the problems, but the process is usually worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was time to build a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measuring-the-problem&quot;&gt;Measuring the Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I could solve the problem, I had to measure it. I remembered &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28457135&quot;&gt;a Hacker News post&lt;/a&gt; about a DIY CO2 monitor and ordered the parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My soldering skills were rusty, so a helpful stranger at the local maker space coached me through pin soldering without frying the sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-diy_v4_assembled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Assembled DIY Air quality monitor by AirGradient&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the new sensor on my nightstand. The next morning, the results were bad. While fresh air sits at 400 ppm and stuffiness symptoms begin around 1,000 ppm, my room was peaking at &lt;strong&gt;1,700 ppm&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;
While it isn’t &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt;, it still might’ve been the reason for my morning grogginess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Overnight CO2&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-SpOXU&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SpOXU/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;396&quot; data-external=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var t in a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;r.style.height=d}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-main-idea&quot;&gt;The Main Idea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rental agreement meant I couldn’t drill holes in walls. The only way for air to get in or out was the 18mm gap under my door. This led to my main idea: &lt;strong&gt;if I could actively push stale air &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; from under the door, the negative pressure in the room would pull fresh air &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; through the trickle vent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heart of this system would be a fan. It needed to be powerful enough but also quiet. My mind went straight to Noctua, a brand PC builders use for silent fans. I chose the NF-F12 PWM model, which has high static pressure (good for pushing air through tight spaces) and low noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the main design challenge: how to funnel the air from a round 120mm fan into a long, thin gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pizza-box-prototype&quot;&gt;The Pizza Box Prototype&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started designing a duct in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery&quot;&gt;CadQuery&lt;/a&gt;, a Python library for making 3D models. I hoped current LLMs could create the 3D model from my description alone, but I was quickly proven wrong. So I did it the old-fashioned way, defining it myself part by part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-v1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A CAD drawing of the first, complicated 3D model showing a fan housing, a 90-degree turn, and a rectangular outlet.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Blue was the part to be used to tie the rope to. French flag is accidental&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first design, I planned to mount the fan and duct directly onto the door with ropes so it would move with it (blue part would push against the door and the notch at the end is for rope). Before starting a long 3D print, I decided to build a quick and dirty prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using two pizza boxes and some tape, I mocked up the shape. I held my cardboard contraption against the door with the rope, just as I’d planned. Then, I let the rope go slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just sat there. On the floor. Perfectly stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a facepalm moment. I had to laugh at myself for over-engineering it. Why did I think it needed a complex mounting system? It could just be a simple, floor-standing unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-pizza_prototype_suspended.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photo of the prototype made from pizza boxes and tape, suspended near the floor by the door.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prototype also &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt;, lowering the CO2 by about 150 ppm with the fan at 40% speed (for lower noise). Now it was time to improve on the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-3d-print&quot;&gt;First 3D Print&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first 3D-printed version came from a research rabbit hole. I’d read that industrial ventilation needs huge, smooth turns to prevent turbulence. The result was a beast—a three-part device with 4mm thick walls that looked like a defensive tower from a strategy game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-v2_printed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photo of the large, three-part 3D printed &amp;quot;tower&amp;quot; duct, alonside the pizza box prototype.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked a little better than the prototype, lowering CO2 by about 200 ppm by itself. But looking at it I realized it was overkill. For my setup, I didn’t need industrial-grade design, the air speed was almost imperceptibly low. I could make the duct much simpler and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;further-improvements&quot;&gt;Further Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to just add more fans side-by-side, but that would get expensive and might be premature. I decided to improve the design first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first breakthrough came one morning, as I was lying in bed; my brain must have been working on the problem in the background. &lt;em&gt;Why the 90-degree turn?&lt;/em&gt; The fan could work in any orientation. By placing the fan on its side, I could get rid of the turn completely. This would save a massive amount of plastic and print time, and also reduce air friction losses from the bend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to CadQuery and designed a much sleeker version. The defensive tower had evolved into a… simple funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-v4-cad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A CAD drawing of the new, simpler funnel-shaped duct.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After printing two new funnels, experimentation led to two more improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of just pushing stale air &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt;, using one fan to actively pull fresh air &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; from the hallway dropped the CO2 by another 100 ppm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was no draft in the room. Air exchange away from the door was slow, likely relying on simple diffusion. I realized I could accelerate this. I already had quiet standing fan so I placed it near the door, aimed inwards. That, surprisingly, cut another 200 ppm without adding more fans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-final-current-system&quot;&gt;The &lt;del&gt;Final&lt;/del&gt; Current System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the area by my door is a mess of wires and fans, but it works. A single power adapter feeds a PWM controller, which then splits the signal to my three fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Peak CO2 based on setup&quot; aria-label=&quot;Bar Chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-DNhwZ&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DNhwZ/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;233&quot; data-external=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2025-06-23-v4-v3-prototype.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My current setup, from left to right: the new funnel duct (v4), the &amp;quot;defensive tower&amp;quot; (v2), and the original pizza box prototype. The second funnel and the standing fan are not shown.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still don’t fully understand why the system works as it does. Is it really creating negative pressure and pulling fresh air through the trickle vent, like I first thought? Or is it just mixing the air near the door and propagating it? The next step is to find a way to measure the actual airflow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other improvement is more practical. Right now, my setup is a functional but messy collection of parts. I’d like to design and print a single, clean enclosure to hold all the fans. It would look better and be much easier to move out of the way when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-am-i-mickey-mouse-now&quot;&gt;So, Am I Mickey Mouse Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t wake up with a cartoonish smile every day. But my mornings &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; better. The grogginess is mostly gone, and I feel more rested. Of course, it could be the summer starting (circadian rhythm/melatonin change, etc), placebo or some combinations of factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, I loved the process. I learned about ventilation, got better at 3D modeling &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; 3D printing, and felt the satisfaction of building something real that solved my own problem. That journey, with all its mistakes and small victories, was the real reward.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><summary type="html">It all started with a comment from my doctor.

&lt;p&gt;It started with sleep problems. I’m very sensitive to sounds during sleep, and throughout my life, I’ve faced various environment-based or neighbor-based noises waking me up. I’ve tried everything: custom-made earplugs, white noise machines, heavy curtains &amp;amp; rugs, meditation, psychotherapy, supplements, perscription drugs – you name it. Everything with various success and not without downsides. The best solution was always &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; somewhere silent. But since I rent and want to live in a city, that’s hard. An apartment can be silent when you evaluate it and noisy at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that was a preface to set the scene, so my jump to designing a soundproof sleep capsule doesn’t seem &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cost-of-noise-maybe-make-this-section-collapseble-i-feel-it-might-distract-from-the-main-theme&quot;&gt;The Cost of Noise [maybe make this section collapseble, I feel it might distract from the main theme]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about being woken up; it’s the anxiety that builds about the downstream consequences. If I don’t get enough sleep, my next day is shot, my decisions suffer, and it can spiral from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to imagine the worst possible outcomes. One anecdote sticks out: In a fashionable part of town I’d just moved into, I heard techno music coming from upstairs on a Friday night.  I become pretty worked up about things that hinder my sleep, and I definitely got worked up that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying earplugs, and audiobooks, the bass still kicked through everything, especially my mood. Bracing for the worst – picturing some unhinged, muscular punk who didn’t care about neighbors – I went upstairs. Emotionally, I was ready for a physical fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The door opened to reveal a lovely young lady. She was completely understanding. We immediately worked out a solution: she moved her small party to a different room further from my apartment. I got her contact info, and she insisted I call if there was ever a problem again. It resolved nicely, a good reminder that my fears are often unfounded and exaggerated, but it highlights the stress noise sensitivity can cause. Building a soundproof capsule is a drastic measure, costly and even potentially dangerous, – all to achieve something that is casually taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tackling-the-problem-the-hard-way-engineering-silence&quot;&gt;Tackling the Problem the Hard Way: Engineering Silence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After moving to Finland and facing familiar noise issues, I thought, maybe I should solve this once and for all, the hard way: by mechanically stopping the sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I embarked on this project. My first thought was that people already solved this for sound recording studios. I dove into books on the topic, found the  bible of building soundproof studios [add a reference], and followed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-frequency noise (AKA bass), the hardest to stop and my main issue during sleep, was the target. High-frequency noise is usually handled by closing windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an engineering acoustics perspective, stopping low-frequency waves requires &lt;strong&gt;mass&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;decoupling&lt;/strong&gt;. Decoupling means the internal wall isn’t rigidly connected to the external one, preventing vibration transmission. I was thinking a ‘room within a room’ – essentially a small soundproof studio inside my existing room. That is, of course, not the entirety of that book, the field has an endless supply of details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Image: Early draft design prototype sketch]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I understood a rough shape of requirements, I started working with a contractor from Upwork to understand how designing physical objects works – something I’d never done before at this scale. Through him, I realized this was a complicated engineering project. The necessary mass for the desired sound attenuation meant the whole thing would weigh over half a ton. This introduced many engineering challenges, for example: a 100kg door needs special construction to help move it, avoid injury or tipping the structure. Entire engineering fields are dedicated to this. The deeper I dug, the more I realized how much I didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with the contractor was an absolute blast, though. I lucked out, he was very supportive, and possessed a wealth of practical knowledge about building real-world products. He brought practicality to my naive approach, emphasizing cost considerations from the start. I’d assumed materials like plywood, drywall, or mineral wool wouldn’t be that expensive, but costs add up quickly. So thinking about materials during the design phase pays off. He was the one who suggested we build a prototype first – a standard concept in software, but here, it was my turn to be that stakeholder  who wants everything perfect on the first try, I had to be persuaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-prototype-unexpected-help-and-humbling-realities&quot;&gt;The Prototype, Unexpected Help, and Humbling Realities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about ventilation? We don’t want it to become a soundproof coffin afterall. But ventilation needs gaps, and gaps let noise in. Designing ventilation for soundproof studios is &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; engineering challenge: letting air in while trapping noise, circulating air effectively, implementing failsafes, alerts, addressing condensation, cleaning… If I were sleeping in it, grime would accumulate. What is this I hear about a hermetic seal?.. My project folder grew exponentially with these myriad engineering challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I isolated and tackled problems one by one, starting with basics. I decided to build a prototype cube with half-meter sides, two decoupled walls, and filling between them, to test the principle: mass + decoupled walls + somewhat hermetic seal = sound attenuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not have the tools needed to build it, so I asked in a local chat group. A complete stranger volunteered to help! First, with lots of advice on where to buy materials, and then he suggested I could use his backyard for construction. He ended up driving with me to the shop and teaching me a few tricks with a saw. My immense gratitude goes out to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Image: Working on the prototype in his backyard]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was another humbling moment. I thought making a cube out of plywood would be easy. But even cutting the six sides presents non-obvious complexities. Knots in the wood can interfere, and fraction-of-a-millimeter errors in cuts add up really fast, potentially hindering the whole assembly. I found a new respect for tradespeople. So much seemingly simple stuff I took for granted – a wooden ladder, a road, even a metal hose clamp – is far from simple to build right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Image: Photo of the finished test cube prototype]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the cube built, I bought a calibrated microphone and tested sound pressure level (SPL) attenuation at different frequencies. It goes in two phases 1) put the mic 2m from a good flat-response speaker, play brown noise and record. 2) put the mic into the prototype box and play the same noise. Compare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Graph: SPL attenuation results from the cube test]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this, I discovered that attenuation varied wildly across frequencies due to the cube’s size and materials. For some frequencies, it was orders of magnitude different. It was very rewarding to build something physical. However, testing the cube was also a moment of disappointment. I compared STL (sound transmission loss) of my cube VS my room door and was disappointed to see that lower frequencies where not filtered at all. At first, I thought my construction was flawed, or my testing setup. Later, theory explained one valley on the graph above (related to cube dimensions and its acoustic modes), but I never figured out the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-detour-into-metamaterials-and-programmatic-cad&quot;&gt;A Detour into Metamaterials and Programmatic CAD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demotivated, I also realized that building something so heavy and potentially dangerous was beyond my current skillset. So, I looked for other solutions. That’s when I found &lt;strong&gt;metamaterials&lt;/strong&gt; – engineered materials with acoustic properties derived from their structure or composition. [insert simple example]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading scientific papers on acoustics. For around 15 years, papers have celebrated metamaterials as the next big thing. By the way, acoustics is a whole separate field. I honestly didn’t know that initially; I assumed it was mostly solved engineering problem. It’s not :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, papers promised sound attenuation using materials without the weight or volume of, say, a 3m cement wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about various metamaterials and found some promising structures. I thought maybe I will not need such heavy walls if some meatamaterial will be very effective. [Add link to the paper] This led to a delightful foray into programmatically-defined CAD. Unlike the manual chore of designing the cube, here I wrote code to generate a 3D mesh for printing. Change the code, bam! New model. It felt like magic. I designed and 3D-printed a prototype array of Helmholtz resonators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[add image of DIY a bass trap]
BTW, the typical foam or holey things hobbyists use often lack solid scientific backing – acoustic forums are full of holy wars about different sound traps. Again, I expected this to be a solved issue and best practices to be obvious; they weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Image: Photo of 3D printed Helmholtz resonator prototypes]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hope-calculations-and-resignation&quot;&gt;Hope, Calculations, and Resignation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found a paper, published in 2023, that captured my imagination. It used plastic plumbing tubes with cleverly cut holes to create paired Helmholtz resonators (they are more effective together then alone), attenuating sound (including low frequencies) across a broad range. Most metamaterials target narrow bands (like a specific airplane engine noise), but my goal was broad attenuation. This paper promised exactly that &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; claimed it didn’t require a hermetic seal! Wow! No need for complex ventilation setup! [&lt;link to=&quot;&quot; paper=&quot;&quot; /&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I emailed the authors with clarifying questions (using LLMs along the way to aid my understanding of the paper). I was enamored: plastic tubes seemed light, cheap, and targeted the needed frequency range. This felt like an emotional high point – lots of hope and excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some months of emails, I was ready to build a prototype. I went online to buy the materials. That’s when I calculated the tubing needed for the smallest possible single-person sleep area: a surprising &lt;strong&gt;250 meters&lt;/strong&gt;. This turned out to be neither cheap nor light, weighing over half a ton. I was right back to the original problem: the construction was too unwieldy. Resignation. At that point, I was already a bit checked out from the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-unexpected-resolution&quot;&gt;An Unexpected Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over this period, my sleep patterns shifted. I no longer have the same problems as last year. I’m not sure exactly why. Since moving to Finland, my life has become more balanced, leading to general stress reduction. I’ve also gotten to know my neighbors; they know my condition and are very understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I disassembled the cube, reclaiming the apparently expensive plywood for future projects (a nod to my earlier naivete about costs). Overall, I spent under 1,000 euros and a solid man-month of effort. It was absolutely a good investment. I enjoyed the deep dives, the learning, the process of trying to build something real. I’m already using the experience in my next hobby project. It was a fascinating journey that made my current lived experice so much richer, for now I see and appreciate complexity and work needed to design and produce everyday things, previously hidden from me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><summary type="html">My Quest for Silence: An Engineer’s Journey into Acoustics to build Soundproof Sleep Capsule</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Should AI Take the Wheel?</title><link href="https://www.lepekhin.com/2025/03/24/Should-AI-Take-the-Wheel" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Should AI Take the Wheel?" /><published>2025-03-24T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2025-03-24T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://www.lepekhin.com/2025/03/24/Should-AI-Take-the-Wheel</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lepekhin.com/2025/03/24/Should-AI-Take-the-Wheel">&lt;p&gt;When my wife asked, “&lt;em&gt;Which decisions should you &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; delegate to AI?&lt;/em&gt;”, I froze mid-thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt_separator--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment, it hit me just how much I’d already outsourced—maybe even too much. She noticed (quicker than I did!) that I’d become increasingly dependent on AI, whose capabilities seem to grow by the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started innocently enough. Small questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What meal can I make with these leftovers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;quickly escalated to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Should we move to another city?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long, decisions I’d usually ponder through journaling, or with trusted friends, had slowly become quick prompts to ChatGPT, answered instantly. Convenience quietly replaced reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begs the question: when do we cross the line from helpful to dangerously passive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;better-decisions&quot;&gt;Better decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I chatted about this with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Aay17ush&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt;. We talked about how little practice we really get with life’s biggest choices: leaving a job, ending a relationship, deciding to move abroad. These choices come up infrequently yet have massive stakes attached, no wonder we struggle with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, AI seems almost irresistible. Trained on humanity’s collective experiences, less affected by the emotional blind spots that hinder our judgment,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; wouldn’t AI naturally tend to make wiser, more objective choices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cheat-code-to-life&quot;&gt;Cheat code to life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet&lt;/em&gt;, even if AI produces objectively better outcomes, could depending on it take away something vital?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of using cheat codes in video games as a child (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IDDQD&lt;/code&gt;, anyone?). At first, cheating felt amazing. Soon afterward, however, I noticed something unexpected—I wasn’t having any fun. The challenge vanished, the tension collapsed, and with them disappeared all the joy and meaning behind playing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder: Could over-depending on AI feel the same way, robbing me of life’s struggles—the very struggles that I suspect build character, resilience, and empathy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve resorted to cheats in games when they became frustratingly hard or when low mood got the best of me, &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; when I knew it would spoil the fun longer-term. If I can’t resist that temptation in gaming, how can I resist the allure of AI making my life easier?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But maybe&lt;/em&gt; the gaming analogy doesn’t perfectly map onto real life. It’s worth exploring the limitations of this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-life-isnt-a-carefully-crafted-video-game&quot;&gt;Real life isn’t a carefully crafted video game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our daily challenges aren’t necessarily meaningful or valuable. Many struggles aren’t instructive—they’re random, painful occurrences delivering little personal growth or satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these circumstances, reducing unnecessary trauma and harm isn’t “cheating”; it’s just common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-all-gain-requires-pain&quot;&gt;Not all gain requires pain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe I’ve overestimated the necessity of struggle and hardship for personal growth. Positive experiences like curiosity and creativity, can also shape who we become. Perhaps AI might help us learn and grow without unnecessarily painful detours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-some-gain-still-might&quot;&gt;…but some gain still might?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s a risk: if we delegate &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; challenging decision, we might lose the valuable tension that drives personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s value in wrestling with uncertainty even when the AI reliably suggests &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; good path. That tension carries meaning—or at the very least feels very human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;local-maxima-trap&quot;&gt;Local maxima trap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further complicating things&lt;/em&gt;, even if AI could perfectly optimize for our preferences, it might trap us in a ‘local maximum’—offering instant relief while stalling long-term growth. Picture an AI that keeps you in barely tolerable relationships or jobs, preventing the discomfort that often sparks transformative change.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In short, short-term comfort might lead to long-term stagnation, much like the marshmallow test suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;convenience-vs-agency&quot;&gt;Convenience vs. Agency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these thoughts bring me back to larger questions of personal agency. As AI improves, will relying on it drain my sense of autonomy? Will life lose some deep, intangible spark if I delegate too many important decisions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current view: we will have to try and see. What comforts me a bit is reflecting on my life thus far. Despite thinking of myself as the &lt;em&gt;instant gratification monkey&lt;/em&gt;, my life tells a different story—I actually go out of my comfort zone and do stuff despite the lure of The Algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I expect AI to become more powerful, more useful, and I also feel confident that I’ll notice if I start veering toward an unfulfilling, agency-lacking existence—and trust myself to course-correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your thoughts, and I’m curious how future-me will reflect on another year of closer reliance on AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To be clear, today’s AIs carry &lt;em&gt;all the biases&lt;/em&gt; inherited from training data; the hope is that they balance each other out. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Current AIs are good at surface-level optimization but may fail to suggest difficult-in-the-moment but ultimately enriching decisions. Future models could potentially integrate secondary- and tertiary-level consequences, vectorize your preferences and &lt;em&gt;your whole psyche&lt;/em&gt;, and ultimately be able to make decisions that are &lt;em&gt;just good for you&lt;/em&gt;. But that is post-singularity AI, firmly in Speculationland. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

When I look at earlier posts, I see something like a trophy board to show everyone how smart and likable I am.&lt;!--excerpt_separator--&gt;
Although everything I wrote about back then was and is really interesting to me, it still seems dishonest somehow. I guess my current mood is different from the one I used to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want to try something different. I’m going to write about the books I absolutely love. Not about philosophy or the role of technology in today’s world. Just 3 books that have made the last seven years much more pleasant for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of writing is harder to do because it makes me more vulnerable, it’s not only about the books but about me and my history with them. It’s something dear to my heart: what if you don’t like it? What if you criticize me and my haphazard way of gushing about these books?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, for the joy of writing this, I’m still willing to take the risk :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading fantasy and science fiction for more than 25 years. I started with Wells, Stanislaw Lem, the Strugatsky brothers, Ray Bradbury, and Philip K. Dick.
After reading through the classics, I discovered the Hugo and Nebula Awards for SF and went through all the finalists. After that, I gradually moved on to lesser and lesser known books and authors.
After scraping the bottom of the barrel for some time, I lucked into web series, books written one chapter at a time and posted on forums or blogs. And how glad I am that I found them, because all the books on this list below are representatives of this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality&quot;&gt;Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Eliezer Yudkowsky [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hpmor.com/&quot;&gt;link to the (free) book&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2022-07-09-My-favorite-fiction-books-hpmor-book-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover showing a hand with fingers poised to snap&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, this is the one book I won’t stop raving about. The following text is just my fanboy noises aimed to get you to read this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sure that fanfics are nothing more than erotic fantasies of teenagers turned into text. In &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; forums and with lots of grammatical errors. Or they are not very funny parody books that want to exploit the fame of the original to cash in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tacky title of this fanfic didn’t help it stand out from that crowd. It was the author’s name that helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliezer was known to me as the champion of the rationality movement and author of many articles on lesswrong.com.
Just the fact that such a person wrote a fanfic began to change my image of what a fanfic is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also helped that the author suggests in the preface to stop reading the book after the fifth chapter if you weren’t hooked. That’s a good heuristic to use with other books as well — it allows you to start a long book without fear of committing to finish it. And this is a book of considerable length.
Fortunately this is one of those cases where the length of a book seems intimidating at first, but then becomes a joy when you realize that many more pages of this fascinating entertainment await you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enjoy this book, &lt;strong&gt;you don’t have to like or even have read the original&lt;/strong&gt; Harry Potter books.
It’s my top 1 recommendation even for people who don’t read much fiction at all (and they love it too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once tried to write my own novel. I researched how to structure it, how to edit it. I used my project management skills to break it down into small chunks and wrote them out. I edited them in iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sucked and the result was crap. I didn’t have the motivation to practice and get better.
But since then, when I re-read HPMOR, I notice all the things the author did that are just. so. good. How it hooks me in emotionally and intellectually. How it changes the cadence without ever being too slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sad at the end of the first read, knowing for a fact that such excitingly captivating books are very few and hard to find.
But there’s hope! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits&quot;&gt;Significant Digits&lt;/a&gt; by Alexander Davis is “the best HPMOR continuation fic” (quote from Elizer). The other books in this post are also similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elizer is mainly working on AI alignment. I don’t want our world to end as much as the next guy, but it’s a pity Eliezer isn’t writing SF books for a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;worm&quot;&gt;Worm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By John C. McCrae [&lt;a href=&quot;https://parahumans.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;link to the (free) book&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2022-07-09-My-favorite-fiction-books-worm-book-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover showing a metropolitan city skyline with an overcast sky&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grimdark world where superheroes aren’t so good and villains aren’t so evil is a popular theme these days, just think of the recent popularity of The Boys TV series. But Worm was the first book of this genre for me, and boy, did it take me away for &lt;em&gt;a ride&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endless cliffhangers and conflict escalation led to many nights where I couldn’t stop reading until sleep finally took me at 4am. Usually when a book is this interesting I finish it quickly, but not this one. This book is 4 Wars and Peaces long. So it was &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I finally finished it, I wanted more. And the fanfic world didn’t disappoint. I’ve been reading Worm fanfics for years. I’m not exaggerating, here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/Worm&quot;&gt;an (incomplete) list of them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over dozens of fanfics, the characters and setting have become familiar to me, all the key situations have been lived through from different angles with different consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I liked Worm because it fit my depressed mood at the time, but after years of fanfics, this world has become the ultimate cozy feel-good read, where I return to old friends and places and relieve fond memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This transition to warm and fuzzy was influenced by some of ack1308’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5180580/ack1308&quot;&gt;wholesome Worm fanfics&lt;/a&gt;, where each and every conflict is resolved in the best possible way.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;worth-the-candle&quot;&gt;Worth The Candle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alexander Wales [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle&quot;&gt;link to the (free) book&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2022-07-09-My-favorite-fiction-books-worth-the-candle-book-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover showing a man fighting with a much bigger humanoid opponent&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LitRPG to rule them all. Interesting mechanics, but not too much of it. So meta and trope-riding, -bending, -exploiting that it’s at least three levels deep.
The author is the king of nuanced worldbuilding. My god! He’s made a variety of worlds with details down history and politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other fiction&lt;/strong&gt;: a horde of ugly goblins invade with mindless fury, killing innocents and destroying millennia-old elven forests. They force the main character to wipe them out. He moves on to the next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book&lt;/strong&gt;: a horde of ugly goblins invades. But their ugliness doesn’t dehumanize them, they’re still people. People who have a long history with elves, with war crimes on both sides. The new political regime of Goblinland forced this goblin contingent to flee their lands or be persecuted as a minority. There are also women and children behind the soldiers. The main character understands all this and when the negotiations fail, it’s not an easy moral decision to kill the goblins. Some of the horde warriors are defeated, but that still leaves the surrendering goblins and their families to deal with. You’ll need logistics to organize it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarian crisis, supply chains, politics, ethics — this book has it all, and that rare depth pleasantly tickles my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author seems so much smarter than I’m that he can conjure up all these worlds and unite them in a story with just the right… everything for me. It’s like reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/&quot;&gt;Slate Star Codex&lt;/a&gt;: someone intelligent has thought through a lot of details and made them accessible to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, and this is a recurring feature of all the books on this list, this book is lusciously long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honorable mention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mother-of-learning&quot;&gt;Mother of Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Domagoj Kurmaic [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning&quot;&gt;link to the (free) book&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A progression fantasy in which the protagonist grows not only in skills, but also in wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first chapter felt a bit awkward in terms of dialogue, but then the story really picked up, the complex situation unravelling with lots of action, and that hooked me in till the satisfying end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><category term="book" /><summary type="html">I wanted to write something without too much virtue signaling.

An endeavour for 2-3 hours that has visible results. A satisfying project, I invite everyone with a light-theme-only blog to try.
&lt;!--excerpt_separator--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2022-02-06-Dark-mode-implementation-for-this-blog--dark-mode-example-picture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An article screenshot, one half of which is in light mode and the other half is in dark mode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CSS Tricks&lt;/em&gt;, of course, has this topic thoroughly covered in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;Complete Guide to Dark Mode on the Web&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll describe what I’ve done in this particular blog and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { ... }&lt;/code&gt; CSS media query which lets me use OS-level user preferences. I chose not to support manual toggling between modes because of two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation involves JavaScript swapping CSS classes and storing state in Local Storage–a harder effort than I wanted for this quick-win project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a user has strong preferences about the dark mode, I imagine such a user already has a way of controlling the interface. Such as a browser plugin that changes the theme, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://darkreader.org/&quot;&gt;Dark Reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As dark mode gains momentum, I think major browsers will display a toggle between modes (not only in Dev Tools) making the effort of creating this toggle myself moot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog uses a modified &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johno/pixyll&quot;&gt;Pixyll theme&lt;/a&gt; that has &lt;strong&gt;32&lt;/strong&gt; SASS files that get compiled into one big CSS file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lepekhin.com/images/2022-02-06-Dark-mode-implementation-for-this-blog--sass-includes-listing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Part of includes listing @importing separate SASS files for links, code, header, etc&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This otherwise reasonable divide-and-conquer approach bites me in the ass here, as I needed to insert the media-query block 17 times. For each style, I wanted to look different when dark. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrey-lepekhin/andrey-lepekhin.github.io/commit/b54227499b737f5042d151f60c39416e88c9ba4b&quot;&gt;the actual commit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could instead place all dark mode styles in one such file, but then I’ll lose the handy separation these files provide. Also, in the future, if I change a light mode style, the proximity of the corresponding dark mode style will remind me to change it as well. Something I might otherwise forget to do and test for.
If there is a better way, please tell me about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that’s basically it: adding media-query styles and selecting particular colors that look good on dark background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China leading the way with more ways to use QR codes than you can shake a stick at (e.g. meet and flirt online at bars): &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2019/10/30/the-power-of-qr-codes/&quot;&gt;Remember QR Codes? They’re More Powerful Than You Think&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Avery Segal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love awkward questions, they make one vulnerable and create a possibility for closeness and/or satisfaction of one’s needs. Here is a paper that helps stop avoiding sensitive questions.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3437468&quot;&gt;I Didn’t Want to Offend You: The Cost of Avoiding Sensitive Questions&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Einav Hart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Eric VanEpps&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Maurice E. Schweitzer&lt;/em&gt;
A quote from the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Across three pilot studies and four experimental studies, we demonstrate that individuals avoid asking sensitive questions, because they fear making others uncomfortable and because of impression management concerns. We demonstrate that this aversion to asking sensitive questions is both costly and misguided.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll only paste one quote as the post itself has just the right composition to be clear enough while not being too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So this is one problem: the inputs to our mental karma system aren’t always closely related to the real merit of a person/thing/idea.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another problem: our interpretation of whether to upvote or downvote something depends on how many upvotes or downvotes it already has. […]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another problem: we are tempted to assign everything about a concept the same score. Eliezer Yudkowsky currently has 2486 karma. How good is Eliezer at philosophy? Apparently somewhere around the level it would take to get 2486 karma. How much does he know about economics? Somewhere around level 2486 would be my guess. How well does he write? Probably well enough to get 2486 karma. Translated into mental terms, this looks like the Halo Effect. Yes, we can pick apart our analyses in greater detail; having read Eliezer’s posts, I know he’s better at some things than others. But that 2486 number is going to cause anchoring-and-adjustment issues even so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But the big problem, the world-breaking problem, is that sticking everything good and bad about something into one big bin and making decisions based on whether it’s a net positive or a net negative is an unsubtle, leaky heuristic completely unsuitable for complicated problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think that I see a hidden meaning, a secret game being played behind the curtains of everyday interactions. Naturally, I like articles about signalling and social games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A player of the Importance Game tries to ascend high enough to reach for something that will set her above her interlocutor, a player of the Leveling Game reaches down low enough to hit common ground. The former needs to signal enough power to establish a hierarchy; the latter enough powerlessness to establish equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In an academic context, I’ve noticed that complaining about how busy one is hits a sweet spot of oppression—I cannot manage my life!—and importance—because I am so in demand! When you’re playing with a master, it can be hard to tell which game you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ending of the article is too unclear for my taste, but then I’m no philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrey Lepekhin</name></author><summary type="html">Who Wants to Play the Status Game? by Agnes Callard</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Some programming idioms explained</title><link href="https://www.lepekhin.com/2020/02/23/Some-programming-idioms-explained" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Some programming idioms explained" /><published>2020-02-23T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-02-23T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://www.lepekhin.com/2020/02/23/Some-programming-idioms-explained</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lepekhin.com/2020/02/23/Some-programming-idioms-explained">&lt;p&gt;As a perpetually novice programmer, it was nice to see the reasons behind some popular idioms explained. &lt;!--excerpt_separator--&gt;Like why “Maintainability counts” or “Avoid package level state”.
Also this way of seeing developer work as preparation for inevitable change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Change is the name of the game we’re in. What we do as programmers is manage change. When we do that well we call it design, or architecture. When we do it badly we call it technical debt, or legacy code.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you are writing a program that works perfectly, one time, for one fixed set of inputs then nobody cares if the code is good or bad because ultimately the output of the program is all the business cares about.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But this is never true. Software has bugs, requirements change, inputs change, and very few programs are written solely to be executed once, thus your program will change over time. Maybe it’s you who’ll be tasked with this, more likely it will be someone else, but someone has to change that code. Someone has to maintain that code.&lt;/p&gt;
